<h2>HENRI FR&Eacute;D&Eacute;RIC AMIEL--(Continued from Volume
I)</h2>
<p>to the storms of air and sea; and while the soul of Mozart seems
to dwell on the ethereal peaks of Olympus, that of Beethoven climbs
shuddering the storm-beaten sides of a Sinai. Blessed be they both!
Each represents a moment of the ideal life, each does us good. Our
love is due to both.</p>
<a name="P1_01"></a>
<p>Self-interest is but the survival of the animal in us. Humanity
only begins for man with self-surrender.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_02"></a>
<p>MAY 27TH, 1857.--Wagner's is a powerful mind endowed with strong
poetical sensitiveness. His work is even more poetical than
musical. The suppression of the lyrical element, and therefore of
melody, is with him a systematic <i>parti pris.</i> No more duos or
trios; monologue and the aria are alike done away with. There
remains only declamation, the recitative, and the choruses. In
order to avoid the conventional in singing, Wagner falls into
another convention,--that of not singing at all. He subordinates
the voice to articulate speech, and for fear lest the muse should
take flight he clips her wings; so that his works are rather
symphonic dramas than operas. The voice is brought down to the rank
of an instrument, put on a level with the violins, the hautboys,
and the drums, and treated instrumentally. Man is deposed from his
superior position, and the centre of gravity of the work passes
into the baton of the conductor. It is music
depersonalized,--neo-Hegelian music,--music multiple instead of
individual. If this is so, it is indeed the music of the
future,--the music of the socialist democracy replacing the art
which is aristocratic, heroic, or subjective.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_03"></a>
<p>DECEMBER 4TH, 1863.--The whole secret of remaining young in
spite of years, and even of gray hairs, is to cherish enthusiasm in
one's self, by poetry, by contemplation, by charity,--that is, in
fewer words, by the maintenance of harmony in the soul.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_04"></a>
<p>APRIL 12TH, 1858.--The era of equality means the triumph of
mediocrity. It is disappointing, but inevitable; for it is one of
time's revenges.... Art no doubt will lose, but justice will gain.
Is not universal leveling down the law of nature?... The world is
striving with all its force for the destruction of what it has
itself brought forth!</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_05"></a>
<p>MARCH 1ST, 1869.--From the point of view of the ideal, humanity
is <i>triste</i> and ugly. But if we compare it with its probable
origins, we see that the human race has not altogether wasted its
time. Hence there are three possible views of history: the view of
the pessimist, who starts from the ideal; the view of the optimist,
who compares the past with the present; and the view of the
hero-worshiper, who sees that all progress whatever has cost oceans
of blood and tears.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_06"></a>
<p>AUGUST 31ST, 1869.--I have finished Schopenhauer. My mind has
been a tumult of opposing systems,--Stoicism, Quietism, Buddhism,
Christianity. Shall I never be at peace with myself? If
impersonality is a good, why am I not consistent in the pursuit of
it? and if it is a temptation, why return to it, after having
judged and conquered it?</p>
<p>Is happiness anything more than a conventional fiction? The
deepest reason for my state of doubt is that the supreme end and
aim of life seems to me a mere lure and deception. The individual
is an eternal dupe, who never obtains what he seeks, and who is
forever deceived by hope. My instinct is in harmony with the
pessimism of Buddha and of Schopenhauer. It is a doubt which never
leaves me, even in my moments of religious fervor. Nature is indeed
for me a Ma&iuml;a; and I look at her, as it were, with the eyes of
an artist. My intelligence remains skeptical. What, then, do I
believe in? I do not know. And what is it I hope for? It would be
difficult to say. Folly! I believe in goodness, and I hope that
good will prevail. Deep within this ironical and disappointed being
of mine there is a child hidden--a frank, sad, simple creature, who
believes in the ideal, in love, in holiness, and all heavenly
superstitions. A whole millennium of idyls sleeps in my heart; I am
a pseudo-skeptic, a pseudo-scoffer.</p>
"Borne dans sa nature, infini dans ses voeux,<br>
L'homme est un dieu tomb&eacute; qui se souvient des cieux."<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_07"></a>
<p>MARCH 17TH, 1870.--This morning the music of a brass band which
had stopped under my windows moved me almost to tears. It exercised
an indefinable, nostalgic power over me; it set me dreaming of
another world, of infinite passion and supreme happiness. Such
impressions are the echoes of Paradise in the soul; memories of
ideal spheres whose sad sweetness ravishes and intoxicates the
heart. O Plato! O Pythagoras! ages ago you heard these harmonies,
surprised these moments of inward ecstasy,--knew these divine
transports! If music thus carries us to heaven, it is because music
is harmony, harmony is perfection, perfection is our dream, and our
dream is heaven.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_08"></a>
<p>APRIL 1ST, 1870.--I am inclined to believe that for a woman love
is the supreme authority,--that which judges the rest and decides
what is good or evil. For a man, love is subordinate to right. It
is a great passion, but it is not the source of order, the synonym
of reason, the criterion of excellence. It would seem, then, that a
woman places her ideal in the perfection of love, and a man in the
perfection of justice.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_09"></a>
<p>JUNE 5TH, 1870.--The efficacy of religion lies precisely in that
which is not rational, philosophic, nor eternal; its efficacy lies
in the unforeseen, the miraculous, the extraordinary. Thus religion
attracts more devotion in proportion as it demands more
faith,--that is to say, as it becomes more incredible to the
profane mind. The philosopher aspires to explain away all
mysteries, to dissolve them into light. It is mystery, on the other
hand, which the religious instinct demands and pursues: it is
mystery which constitutes the essence of worship, the power of
proselytism. When the cross became the "foolishness" of the cross,
it took possession of the masses. And in our own day, those who
wish to get rid of the supernatural, to enlighten religion, to
economize faith, find themselves deserted, like poets who should
declaim against poetry, or women who should decry love. Faith
consists in the acceptance of the incomprehensible, and even in the
pursuit of the impossible, and is self-intoxicated with its own
sacrifices, its own repeated extravagances.</p>
<p>It is the forgetfulness of this psychological law which
stultifies the so-called liberal Christianity. It is the
realization of it which constitutes the strength of
Catholicism.</p>
<p>Apparently, no positive religion can survive the supernatural
element which is the reason for its existence. Natural religion
seems to be the tomb of all historic cults. All concrete religions
die eventually in the pure air of philosophy. So long then as the
life of nations is in need of religion as a motive and sanction of
morality, as food for faith, hope, and charity, so long will the
masses turn away from pure reason and naked truth, so long will
they adore mystery, so long--and rightly so--will they rest in
faith, the only region where the ideal presents itself to them in
an attractive form.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_10"></a>
<p>OCTOBER 26TH, 1870.--If ignorance and passion are the foes of
popular morality, it must be confessed that moral indifference is
the malady of the cultivated classes. The modern separation of
enlightenment and virtue, of thought and conscience, of the
intellectual aristocracy from the honest and vulgar crowd, is the
greatest danger that can threaten liberty. When any society
produces an increasing number of literary exquisites, of satirists,
skeptics, and <i>beaux esprits</i>, some chemical disorganization
of fabric may be inferred. Take, for example, the century of
Augustus and that of Louis XV. Our cynics and railers are mere
egotists, who stand aloof from the common duty, and in their
indolent remoteness are of no service to society against any ill
which may attack it. Their cultivation consists in having got rid
of feeling. And thus they fall farther and farther away from true
humanity, and approach nearer to the demoniacal nature. What was it
that Mephistopheles lacked? Not intelligence, certainly, but
goodness.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_11"></a>
<p>DECEMBER 11TH, 1875.--The ideal which the wife and mother makes
for herself, the manner in which she understands duty and life,
contain the fate of the community. Her faith becomes the star of
the conjugal ship, and her love the animating principle that
fashions the future of all belonging to her. Woman is the salvation
or destruction of the family. She carries its destinies in the
folds of her mantle.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_12"></a>
<p>JANUARY 22D, 1875.--The thirst for truth is not a French
passion. In everything appearance is preferred to reality, the
outside to the inside, the fashion to the material, that which
shines to that which profits, opinion to conscience. That is to
say, the Frenchman's centre of gravity is always outside him,--he
is always thinking of others, playing to the gallery. To him
individuals are so many zeros: the unit which turns them into a
number must be added from outside; it may be royalty, the writer of
the day, the favorite newspaper, or any other temporary master of
fashion.--All this is probably the result of an exaggerated
sociability, which weakens the soul's forces of resistance,
destroys its capacity for investigation and personal conviction,
and kills in it the worship of the ideal.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_13"></a>
<p>DECEMBER 9TH, 1877.--The modern haunters of Parnassus carve urns
of agate and of onyx; but inside the urns what is there?--Ashes.
Their work lacks feeling, seriousness, sincerity, and pathos--in a
word, soul and moral life. I cannot bring myself to sympathize with
such a way of understanding poetry. The talent shown is
astonishing, but stuff and matter are wanting. It is an effort of
the imagination to stand alone--substitute for everything else. We
find metaphors, rhymes, music, color, but not man, not humanity.
Poetry of this factitious kind may beguile one at twenty, but what
can one make of it at fifty? It reminds me of Pergamos, of
Alexandria, of all the epochs of decadence when beauty of form hid
poverty of thought and exhaustion of feeling. I strongly share the
repugnance which this poetical school arouses in simple people. It
is as though it only cared to please the world-worn, the
over-subtle, the corrupted, while it ignores all normal healthy
life, virtuous habits, pure affections, steady labor, honesty, and
duty. It is an affectation, and because it is an affectation the
school is struck with sterility. The reader desires in the poem
something better than a juggler in rhyme, or a conjurer in verse;
he looks 'to find in him a painter of life, a being who thinks,
loves, and has a conscience, who feels passion and repentance.</p>
<a name="P1_16"></a>
<p>The true critic strives for a clear vision of things as they
are--for justice and fairness; his effort is to get free from
himself, so that he may in no way disfigure that which he wishes to
understand or reproduce. His superiority to the common herd lies in
this effort, even when its success is only partial. He distrusts
his own senses, he sifts his own impressions, by returning upon
them from different sides and at different times, by comparing,
moderating, shading, distinguishing, and so endeavoring to approach
more and more nearly to the formula which represents the maximum of
truth.</p>
<a name="P1_15"></a>
<p>The art which is grand and yet simple is that which presupposes
the greatest elevation both in artist and in public.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_14"></a>
<p>MAY 19TH, 1878.--Criticism is above all a gift, an intuition, a
matter of tact and <i>flair</i>; it cannot be taught or
demonstrated,--it is an art. Critical genius means an aptitude for
discerning truth under appearances or in disguises which conceal
it; for discovering it in spite of the errors of testimony, the
frauds of tradition, the dust of time, the loss or alteration of
texts. It is the sagacity of the hunter whom nothing deceives for
long, and whom no ruse can throw off the trail. It is the talent of
the <i>Juge d'Instruction</i> who knows how to interrogate
circumstances, and to extract an unknown secret from a thousand
falsehoods. The true critic can understand everything, but he will
be the dupe of nothing, and to no convention will he sacrifice his
duty, which is to find out and proclaim truth. Competent learning,
general cultivation, absolute probity, accuracy of general view,
human sympathy, and technical capacity,--how many things are
necessary to the critic, without reckoning grace, delicacy,
<i>savoir vivre</i>, and the gift of happy phrasemaking!</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_17"></a>
<p>MAY 22D, 1879 (Ascension Day).--Wonderful and delicious weather.
Soft, caressing sunlight,--the air a limpid blue,--twitterings of
birds; even the distant voices of the city have something young and
springlike in them. It is indeed a new birth. The ascension of the
Savior of men is symbolized by the expansion, this heavenward
yearning of nature.... I feel myself born again; all the windows of
the soul are clear. Forms, lines, tints, reflections, sounds,
contrasts, and harmonies, the general play and interchange of
things,--it is all enchanting!</p>
<p>In my courtyard the ivy is green again, the chestnut-tree is
full of leaf, the Persian lilac beside the little fountain is
flushed with red and just about to flower; through the wide
openings to the right and left of the old College of Calvin I see
the Sal&egrave;ve above the trees of St. Antoine, the Voirons above
the hill of Cologny; while the three flights of steps which, from
landing to landing, lead between two high walls from the Rue
Verdaine to the terrace of the Tranch&eacute;es, recall to one's
imagination some old city of the south, a glimpse of Perugia or of
Malaga.</p>
<p>All the bells are ringing. It is the hour of worship. A
historical and religious impression mingles with the picturesque,
the musical, the poetical impressions of the scene. All the peoples
of Christendom--all the churches scattered over the globe--are
celebrating at this moment the glory of the Crucified.</p>
<p>And what are those many nations doing who have other prophets,
and honor the Divinity in other ways--the Jews, the Mussulmans, the
Buddhists, the Vishnuists, the Guebers? They have other sacred
days, other rites, other solemnities, other beliefs. But all have
some religion, some ideal end for life--all aim at raising man
above the sorrows and smallnesses of the present, and of the
individual existence. All have faith in something greater than
themselves, all pray, all bow, all adore; all see beyond nature,
Spirit, and beyond evil, Good. All bear witness to the Invisible.
Here we have the link which binds all peoples together. All men are
equally creatures of sorrow and desire, of hope and fear. All long
to recover some lost harmony with the great order of things, and to
feel themselves approved and blessed by the Author of the universe.
All know what suffering is, and yearn for happiness. All know what
sin is, and feel the need of pardon.</p>
<p>Christianity, reduced to its original simplicity, is the
reconciliation of the sinner with God, by means of the certainty
that God loves in spite of everything, and that he chastises
because he loves. Christianity furnished a new motive and a new
strength for the achievement of moral perfection. It made holiness
attractive by giving to it the air of filial gratitude.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<a name="P1_18"></a>
<p>JULY 28TH, 1880.--This afternoon I have had a walk in the
sunshine, and have just come back rejoicing in a renewed communion
with nature. The waters of the Rhone and the Arve, the murmur of
the river, the austerity of its banks, the brilliancy of the
foliage, the play of the leaves, the splendor of the July sunlight,
the rich fertility of the fields, the lucidity of the distant
mountains, the whiteness of the glaciers under the azure serenity
of the sky, the sparkle and foam of the mingling rivers, the leafy
masses of the La B&acirc;tie woods,--all and everything delighted
me. It seemed to me as though the years of strength had come back
to me. I was overwhelmed with sensations. I was surprised and
grateful. The universal life carried me on its breast; the summer's
caress went to my heart. Once more my eyes beheld the vast
horizons, the soaring peaks, the blue lakes, the winding valleys,
and all the free outlets of old days. And yet there was no painful
sense of longing. The scene left upon me an indefinable impression,
which was neither hope, nor desire, nor regret, but rather a sense
of emotion, of passionate impulse, mingled with admiration and
anxiety. I am conscious at once of joy and of want; beyond what I
possess I see the impossible and the unattainable; I gauge my own
wealth and poverty: in a word, I am and I am not--my inner state is
one of contradiction, because it is one of transition.</p>

<p>f the life of this lyric poet we have little exact knowledge. We
know that he was an Ionian Greek, and therefore by racial type a
luxury-loving, music-loving Greek, born in the city of Teos on the
coast of Asia Minor. The year was probably B.C. 562. With a few
fellow-citizens, it is supposed that he fled to Thrace and founded
Abdera when Cyrus the Great, or his general Harpagus, was
conquering the Greek cities of the coast. Abdera, however, was too
new to afford luxurious living, and the singing Ionian soon found
his way to more genial Samos, whither the fortunes of the world
then seemed converging. Polycrates was "tyrant," in the old Greek
sense of irresponsible ruler; but withal so large-minded and
far-sighted a man that we may use a trite comparison and say that
under him his island was, to the rest of Greece, as Florence in the
time of Lorenzo the Magnificent was to the rest of Italy, or Athens
in the time of Pericles to the other Hellenic States. Anacreon
became his tutor, and may have been of his council; for Herodotus
says that when Oroetes went to see Polycrates he found him in the
men's apartment with Anacreon the Teian. Another historian says
that he tempered the stern will of the ruler. Still another relates
that Polycrates once presented him with five talents, but that the
poet returned the sum after two nights made sleepless from thinking
what he would do with his riches, saying "it was not worth the care
it cost."</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-024.png" width="45%" alt=
""><br>
<b>ANACREON</b></p>
<p>After the murder of Polycrates, Hipparchus, who ruled at Athens,
sent a trireme to fetch the poet. Like his father Pisistratus,
Hipparchus endeavored to further the cause of letters by calling
poets to his court. Simonides of Ceos was there; and Lasus of
Hermione, the teacher of Pindar; with many rhapsodists or
minstrels, who edited the poems of Homer and chanted his lays at
the Panathen&aelig;a, or high festival of Athena, which the people
celebrated every year with devout and magnificent show. Amid this
brilliant company Anacreon lived and sang until Hipparchus fell
(514) by the famous conspiracy of Harmodius and Aristogeiton. He
then returned to his native Teos, and according to a legend, died
there at the age of eighty-five, choked by a grape-seed.</p>
<p>Anacreon was a lyrist of the first order. Plato's poet says of
him in the 'Symposium,' "When I hear the verses of Sappho or
Anacreon, I set down my cup for very shame of my own performance."
He composed in Greek somewhat, to use a very free comparison, as
Herrick did in English, expressing the unrefined passion and
excesses which he saw, just as the Devonshire parson preserved the
spirit of the country festivals of Old England in his vivid
verse.</p>
<p>To Anacreon music and poetry were inseparable. The poet of his
time recited his lines with lyre in hand, striking upon it in the
measure he thought best suited to his song. Doubtless the poems of
Anacreon were delivered in this way. His themes were simple,--wine,
love, and the glorification of youth and poetry; but his
imagination and poetic invention so animated every theme that it is
the perfect rendering which we see, not the simplicity of the
commonplace idea. His delicacy preserves him from grossness, and
his grace from wantonness. In this respect his poems are a fair
illustration of the Greek sense of self-limitation, which guided
the art instincts of that people and made them the creators of
permanent canons of taste.</p>
<p>Anacreon had no politics, no earnest interest in the affairs of
life, no morals in the large meaning of that word, no aims reaching
further than the merriment and grace of the moment. Loving luxury
and leisure, he was the follower of a pleasure-loving court. His
cares are that the bowl is empty, that age is joyless, that women
tell him he is growing gray. He is closely paralleled in this by
one side of B&eacute;ranger; but the Frenchman's soul had a
passionately earnest half which the Greek entirely lacked. Nor is
there ever any outbreak of the deep yearning, the underlying
melancholy, which pervades and now and then interrupts, like a
skeleton at the feast, the gayest verses of Omar Khayyam.</p>
<p>His metres, like his matter, are simple and easy. So imitators,
perhaps as brilliant as the master, have sprung up and produced a
mass of songs; and at this time it remains in doubt whether any
complete poem of Anacreon remains untouched. For this reason the
collection is commonly termed 'Anacreontics'. Some of the poems are
referred to the school of Gaza and the fourth century after Christ,
and some to the secular teachings and refinement of the monks of
the Middle Ages. Since the discovery and publication of the text by
Henry Stephens, in 1554, poets have indulged their lighter fancies
in such songs, and a small literature of delicate trifles now
exists under the name of 'Anacreontics' in Italian, German, and
English. Bergk's recension of the poems appeared in 1878. The
standard translations, or rather imitations in English, are those
of Cowley and Moore. The Irish poet was not unlike in nature to the
ancient Ionian. Moore's fine voice in the London drawing-rooms
echoes at times the note of Anacreon in the men's quarters of
Polycrates or the symposia of Hipparchus. The joy of feasting and
music, the color of wine, and the scent of roses, alike inspire the
songs of each.</p>

<h2><a name="HANS_CHRISTIAN_ANDERSEN"></a>HANS CHRISTIAN
ANDERSEN</h2>
<h3>(1805-1875)</h3>
<h3>BY BENJAMIN W. WELLS</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he place of Hans Christian Andersen in literature is that of the
"Children's Poet," though his best poetry is prose. He was born in
the ancient Danish city of Odense, on April 2d, 1805, of poor and
shiftless parents. He had little regular instruction, and few
childish associates. His youthful imagination was first stimulated
by La Fontaine's 'Fables' and the 'Arabian Nights,' and he showed
very early a dramatic instinct, trying to act and even to imitate
Shakespeare, though, as he says, "hardly able to spell a single
word correctly." It was therefore natural that the visit of a
dramatic company to Odense, in 1818, should fire his fancy to seek
his theatrical fortune in Copenhagen; whither he went in September,
1819, with fifteen dollars in his pocket and a letter of
introduction to a danseuse at the Royal Theatre, who not
unnaturally took her strange visitor for a lunatic, and showed him
the door. For four years he labored diligently, suffered acutely,
and produced nothing of value; though he gained some influential
friends, who persuaded the king to grant him a scholarship for
three years, that he might prepare for the university.</p>
<p>Though he was neither a brilliant nor a docile pupil, he did not
exhaust the generous patience of his friends, who in 1829 enabled
him to publish by subscription his first book, 'A Journey on Foot
from Holm Canal to the East Point of Amager' a fantastic arabesque,
partly plagiarized and partly parodied from the German
romanticists, but with a na&iuml;vet&eacute; that might have
disarmed criticism.</p>
<p>In 1831 there followed a volume of poems, the sentimental and
rather mawkish 'Fantasies and Sketches,' product of a journey in
Jutland and of a silly love affair. This book was so harshly
criticized that he resolved to seek a refuge and new literary
inspiration in a tour to Germany; for all through his life,
traveling was Andersen's stimulus and distraction, so that he
compares himself, later, to a pendulum "bound to go backward and
forward, tic, toc, tic, toc, till the clock stops, and down I
lie."</p>
<a name="illus0500.jpg"></a><br>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illus0500.jpg" width="50%" alt=
""></p>
<br>
<p>This German tour inspired his first worthy book, 'Silhouettes,'
with some really admirable pages of description. His success
encouraged him to attempt the drama again, where he failed once
more, and betook himself for relief to Paris and Italy, with a
brief stay in the Jura Mountains, which is delightfully described
in his novel, 'O.T.'</p>
<p>Italy had on him much the same clarifying effect that it had on
Goethe; and his next book, the novel 'Improvisatore' (1835),
achieved and deserved a European recognition. Within ten years the
book was translated into six languages. It bears the mark of its
date in its romantic sentiments. There is indeed no firm
character-drawing, here or in any of his novels; but the book still
claims attention for its exquisite descriptions of Italian life and
scenery.</p>
<p>The year 1835 saw also Andersen's first essay in the 'Wonder
Stories' which were to give him his lasting title to grateful
remembrance. He did not think highly of this work at the time,
though his little volume contained the now-classic 'Tinderbox,' and
'Big Claus and Little Claus.' Indeed, he always chafed a little at
the modest fame of a writer for children; but he continued for
thirty-seven years to publish those graceful fancies, which in
their little domain still hold the first rank, and certainly gave
the freest scope to Andersen's qualities, while they masked his
faults and limitations.</p>
<p>He turned again from this "sleight of hand with Fancy's golden
apples," to the novel, in the 'O.T.' (1836), which marks no advance
on the 'Improvisatore'; and in the next year he published his best
romance, 'Only a Fiddler,' which is still charming for its
autobiographical touches, its genuine humor, and its deep pathos.
At the time, this book assured his European reputation; though it
has less interest for us to-day than the 'Tales,' or the 'Picture
Book without Pictures' (1840), where, perhaps more than anywhere
else in his work, the child speaks with all the na&iuml;vet&eacute;
of his nature.</p>
<p>A journey to the East was reflected in 'A Poet's Bazaar' (1842);
and these years contain also his last unsuccessful dramatic
efforts, 'The King Dreams' and 'The New Lying-in Room.' In 1843 he
was in Paris, in 1844 in Germany, and in the next year he extended
his wanderings to Italy and England, where Mary Howitt's
translations had assured him a welcome. Ten years later he
revisited England as the guest of Dickens at Gadshill.</p>
<p>The failure of an epic, 'Ahasuerus' (1847), and of a novel, 'The
Two Baronesses' (1849), made him turn with more interest to wonder
tales and fairy dramas, which won a considerable success; and when
the political troubles of 1848 directed his wanderings toward
Sweden, he made from them 'I Sverrig' (In Sweden: 1849), his most
exquisite book of travels. As Europe grew peaceful again he resumed
his indefatigable wanderings, visiting Germany, France, Italy,
Switzerland, Spain, Bohemia, and England; printing between 1852 and
1862 nine little volumes of stories, the mediocre but successful
'In Spain' (1860), and his last novel, 'To Be or Not To Be' (1857),
which reflects the religious speculations of his later years.</p>
<p>He was now in comparatively easy circumstances, and passed the
last fifteen years of his life unharassed by criticism, and
surrounded with the 'honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,'
that should accompany old age. It was not until 1866 that he made
himself a home; and even at sixty-one he said the idea 'positively
frightened him--he knew he should run away from it as soon as ever
the first warm sunbeam struck him, like any other bird of
passage.'</p>
<p>In 1869 he celebrated his literary jubilee. In 1872 he finished
his last 'Stories.' That year he met with an accident in Innsbruck
from which he never recovered. Kind friends eased his invalid
years; and so general was the grief at his illness that the
children of the United States collected a sum of money for his
supposed necessities, which at his request took the form of books
for his library. A few months later, after a brief and painless
illness, he died, August 1st, 1875. His admirers had already
erected a statue in his honor, and the State gave him a magnificent
funeral; but his most enduring monument is that which his 'Wonder
Tales' are still building all around the world.</p>
<p>The character of Andersen is full of curious contrasts. Like the
French fabulist, La Fontaine, he was a child all his life, and
often a spoiled child; yet he joined to childlike simplicity no
small share of worldly wisdom. Constant travel made him a shrewd
observer of detail, but his self-absorption kept him from sympathy
with the broad political aspirations of his generation.</p>
<p>In the judgment of his friends and critics, his autobiographical
'Story of My Life' is strangely unjust, and he never understood the
limitations of his genius. He was not fond of children, nor
personally attractive to them, though his letters to them are
charming.</p>
<p>In personal appearance he was limp, ungainly, awkward, and odd,
with long lean limbs, broad flat hands, and feet of striking size.
His eyes were small and deep-set, his nose very large, his neck
very long; but he masked his defects by studied care in dress, and
always fancied he looked distinguished, delighting to display his
numerous decorations on his evening dress in complacent
profusion.</p>
<p>On Andersen's style there is a remarkably acute study by his
fellow-countryman Brandes, in 'Kritiker og Portraite' (Critiques
and Portraits), and a useful comment in Boyesen's 'Scandinavian
Literature.' When not perverted by his translators, it is perhaps
better suited than any other to the comprehension of children. His
syntax and rhetoric are often faulty; and in the 'Tales' he does
not hesitate to take liberties even with German, if he can but
catch the vivid, darting imagery of juvenile fancy, the "ohs" and
"ahs" of the nursery, its changing intonations, its fears, its
smiles, its personal appeals, and its venerable devices to spur
attention and kindle sympathy. Action, or imitation, takes the
place of description. We hear the trumpeter's <i>taratantara</i>
and "the pattering rain on the leaves, <i>rum dum dum, rum dum
dum</i>," The soldier "comes marching along, <i>left, right, left,
right</i>." No one puts himself so wholly in the child's place and
looks at nature so wholly with his eyes as Andersen. "If you hold
one of those burdock leaves before your little body it's just like
an apron, and if you put it on your head it's almost as good as an
umbrella, it's so big." Or he tells you that when the sun shone on
the flax, and the clouds watered it, "it was just as nice for it as
it is for the little children to be washed and then get a kiss from
mother: that makes them prettier; of course it does." And here, as
Brandes remarks, every right-minded mamma stops and kisses the
child, and their hearts are warmer for that day's tale.</p>
<p>The starting-point of this art is personification. To the
child's fancy the doll is as much alive as the cat, the broom as
the bird, and even the letters in the copy-book can stretch
themselves. On this foundation he builds myths that tease by a
certain semblance of rationality,--elegiac, more often sentimental,
but at their best, like normal children, without strained pathos or
forced sympathy.</p>
<p>Such personification has obvious dramatic and lyric elements;
but Andersen lacked the technique of poetic and dramatic art, and
marred his prose descriptions, both in novels and books of travel,
by an intrusive egotism and lyric exaggeration. No doubt,
therefore, the most permanent part of his work is that which
popular instinct has selected, the 'Picture Book without Pictures,'
the 'Tales and Stories'; and among these, those will last longest
that have least of the lyric and most of the dramatic element.</p>
<p>Nearly all of Andersen's books are translated in ten uniform but
unnumbered volumes, published by Houghton, Mifflin and Company. Of
the numerous translations of the 'Tales,' Mary Howitt's (1846) and
Sommer's (1893) are the best, though far from faultless.</p>
<p>The 'Life of Hans Christian Andersen' by R. Nisbet Bain (New
York, 1895) is esteemed the best.</p>

<h2>THE STEADFAST TIN SOLDIER</h2>
<center>From 'Collected Fairy Tales,' newly translated</center>
<br>
<p>There were once twenty-five tin soldiers, who were all brothers,
for they were cast out of one old tin spoon. They held their
muskets, and their faces were turned to the enemy; red and blue,
ever so fine, were the uniforms. The first thing they heard in this
world, when the cover was taken from the box where they lay, were
the words, "Tin soldiers!" A little boy shouted it, and clapped his
hands. He had got them because it was his birthday, and now he set
them up on the table. Each soldier was just like the other, only
one was a little different. He had but one leg, for he had been
cast last, and there was not enough tin. But he stood on his one
leg just as firm as the others on two, so he was just the one to be
famous.</p>
<p>On the table where they were set up stood a lot of other
playthings; but what caught your eye was a pretty castle of paper.
Through the little windows you could see right into the halls.
Little trees stood in front, around a bit of looking-glass which
was meant for a lake. Wax swans swam on it and were reflected in
it. That was all very pretty, but still the prettiest thing was a
little girl who stood right in the castle gate. She was cut out of
paper too, but she had a silk dress, and a little narrow blue
ribbon across her shoulders, on which was a sparkling star as big
as her whole face. The little girl lifted her arms gracefully in
the air, for she was a dancer; and then she lifted one leg so high
that the tin soldier could not find it at all, and thought that she
had only one leg, just like himself.</p>
<p>"That would be the wife for me," thought he, "but she is too
fine for me. She lives in a castle, and I have only a box, which I
have to share with twenty-four. That is no house for her. But I
will see whether I can make her acquaintance." Then he lay down at
full length behind a snuff-box which was on the table. From there
he could watch the trig little lady who kept standing on one leg
without losing her balance. When evening came, the other tin
soldiers were all put in their box, and the people in the house
went to bed. Then the playthings began to play, first at
"visiting," then at "war" and at "dancing." The tin soldiers
rattled in their box, for they would have liked to join in it, but
they could not get the cover off. The nutcracker turned
somersaults, and the pencil scrawled over the slate. There was such
a racket that the canary-bird woke up and began to sing, and that
in verses. The only ones that did not stir were the tin soldier and
the little dancer. She stood straight on tiptoe and stretched up
both arms; he was just as steadfast on his one leg. He did not take
his eyes from her a moment.</p>
<p>Now it struck twelve, and bang! up went the cover of the
snuff-box, but it wasn't tobacco in it: no, but a little black
Troll. It was a trick box.</p>
<p>"Tin soldier!" said the Troll, "will you stare your eyes out?"
But the tin soldier made believe he did not hear. "You wait till
morning!" said the Troll.</p>
<p>When morning came, and the children got up, the tin soldier was
put on the window ledge; and whether it was the Troll, or a gust of
wind, all at once the window flew open and the tin soldier fell
head first from the third story. That was an awful fall. He
stretched his leg straight up, and stuck with his bayonet and cap
right between the paving-stones.</p>
<p>The maid and the little boy came right down to hunt for him, but
they couldn't see him, though they came so near that they almost
trod on him. If the tin soldier had called "Here I am," they surely
would have found him; but since he was in uniform he did not think
it proper to call aloud.</p>
<p>Now it began to rain. The drops chased one another. It was a
regular shower. When that was over, two street boys came along.</p>
<p>"Hallo!" said one, "There's a tin soldier. He must be off and
sail."</p>
<p>Then they made a boat out of a newspaper, put the tin soldier in
it, and made him sail down the gutter. Both boys ran beside it, and
clapped their hands. Preserve us! What waves there were in the
gutter, and what a current! It must have rained torrents. The paper
boat rocked up and down, and sometimes it whirled around so that
the tin soldier shivered. But he remained steadfast, did not lose
color, looked straight ahead and held his musket firm.</p>
<p>All at once the boat plunged under a long gutter-bridge. It was
as dark there as it had been in his box.</p>
<p>"Where am I going now?" thought he. "Yes, yes, that is the
Troll's fault. Oh! if the little lady were only in the boat, I
would not care if it were twice as dark."</p>
<p>At that instant there came a great water-rat who lived under the
gutter-bridge.</p>
<p>"Have you a pass?" said the rat. "Show me your pass."</p>
<p>But the tin soldier kept still, and only held his musket the
firmer. The boat rushed on, and the rat behind. Oh! how he gnashed
his teeth, and called to the sticks and straws:--</p>
<p>"Stop him! Stop him! He has not paid toll. He has showed no
pass."</p>
<p>But the current got stronger and stronger. Before he got to the
end of the bridge the tin soldier could see daylight, but he heard
also a rushing noise that might frighten a brave man's heart. Just
think! at the end of the bridge the gutter emptied into a great
canal, which for him was as dangerous as for us to sail down a
great waterfall.</p>
<p>He was so near it already that he could not stop. The boat went
down. The poor tin soldier held himself as straight as he could. No
one should say of him that he had ever blinked his eyes. The boat
whirled three or four times and filled with water. It had to sink.
The tin soldier stood up to his neck in water, and deeper, deeper
sank the boat. The paper grew weaker and weaker. Now the waves went
over the soldier's head. Then he thought of the pretty little
dancer whom he never was to see again, and there rang in the tin
soldier's ears:--</p>
"Farewell, warrior! farewell!<br>
Death shalt thou stiffer."<br>
<p>Now the paper burst in two, and the tin soldier fell
through,--but in that minute he was swallowed by a big fish.</p>
<p>Oh! wasn't it dark in there. It was worse even than under the
gutter-bridge, and besides, so cramped. But the tin soldier was
steadfast, and lay at full length, musket in hand.</p>
<p>The fish rushed around and made the most fearful jumps. At last
he was quite still, and something went through him like a lightning
flash. Then a bright light rushed in, and somebody called aloud,
"The tin soldier!" The fish had been caught, brought to market,
sold, and been taken to the kitchen, where the maid had slit it up
with a big knife. She caught the soldier around the body and
carried him into the parlor, where everybody wanted to see such a
remarkable man who had traveled about in a fish's belly. But the
tin soldier was not a bit proud. They put him on the table, and
there--well! what strange things do happen in the world--the tin
soldier was in the very same room that he had been in before. He
saw the same children, and the same playthings were on the table,
the splendid castle with the pretty little dancer; she was still
standing on one leg, and had the other high in the air. She was
steadfast, too. That touched the tin soldier so that he could
almost have wept tin tears, but that would not have been proper. He
looked at her and she looked at him, but they said nothing at
all.</p>
<p>Suddenly one of the little boys seized the tin soldier and threw
him right into the tile-stove, although he had no reason to. It was
surely the Troll in the box who was to blame.</p>
<p>The tin soldier stood in full light and felt a fearful heat; but
whether that came from the real fire, or from his glowing love, he
could not tell. All the color had faded from him; but whether this
had happened on the journey, or whether it came from care, no one
could say. He looked at the little girl and she looked at him. He
felt that he was melting, but still he stood steadfast, musket in
hand. Then a door opened. A whiff of air caught the dancer, and she
flew like a sylph right into the tile-stove to the tin soldier,
blazed up in flame, and was gone. Then the tin soldier melted to a
lump, and when the maid next day took out the ashes, she found him
as a little tin heart. But of the dancer only the star was left,
and that was burnt coal-black.</p>

<br>
<h2>THE TEAPOT</h2>
<center>From 'Riverside Literature Series': 1891, by Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co.</center>
<br>
<p>There was a proud Teapot, proud of being porcelain, proud of its
long spout, proud of its broad handle. It had something before and
behind--the spout before, the handle behind--and that was what it
talked about. But it did not talk of its lid--that was cracked, it
was riveted, it had faults; and one does not talk about one's
faults--there are plenty of others to do that. The cups, the
cream-pot, the sugar-bowl, the whole tea-service would be reminded
much more of the lid's weakness, and talk about that, than of the
sound handle and the remarkable spout. The Teapot knew it.</p>
<p>"I know you," it said within itself, "I know well enough, too,
my fault; and I am well aware that in that very thing is seen my
humility, my modesty. We all have faults, but then one also has a
talent. The cups get a handle, the sugar-bowl a lid; I get both,
and one thing besides in front which they never got,--I get a
spout, and that makes me a queen on the tea-table. The sugar-bowl
and cream-pot are good-looking serving maids; but I am the one who
gives, yes, the one high in council. I spread abroad a blessing
among thirsty mankind. In my insides the Chinese leaves are worked
up in the boiling, tasteless water."</p>
<p>All this said the Teapot in its fresh young life. It stood on
the table that was spread for tea, it was lifted by a very delicate
hand; but the very delicate hand was awkward, the Teapot fell. The
spout snapped off, the handle snapped off; the lid was no worse to
speak of--the worst had been spoken of that. The Teapot lay in a
swoon on the floor, while the boiling water ran out of it. It was a
horrid shame, but the worst was that they jeered at it; they jeered
at it, and not at the awkward hand.</p>
<p>"I never shall lose the memory of that!" said the Teapot, when
it afterward talked to itself of the course of its life. "I was
called an invalid, and placed in a corner, and the day after was
given away to a woman who begged victuals. I fell into poverty, and
stood dumb both outside and in; but there, as I stood, began my
better life. One is one thing and becomes quite another. Earth was
placed in me: for a Teapot that is the same as being buried, but in
the earth was placed a flower bulb. Who placed it there, who gave
it, I know not; given it was, and it took the place of the Chinese
leaves and the boiling water, the broken handle and spout. And the
bulb lay in the earth, the bulb lay in me, it became my heart, my
living heart, such as I never before had. There was life in me,
power and might. My pulses beat, the bulb put forth sprouts, it was
the springing up of thoughts and feelings; they burst forth in
flower. I saw it, I bore it, I forgot myself in its delight.
Blessed is it to forget one's self in another. The bulb gave me no
thanks, it did not think of me--it was admired and praised. I was
so glad at that: how happy must it have been! One day I heard it
said that it ought to have a better pot. I was thumped on my
back--that was rather hard to bear; but the flower was put in a
better pot--and I was thrown away in the yard, where I lie as an
old crock. But I have the memory: <i>that</i> I can never
lose."</p>

<h2>THE UGLY DUCKLING</h2>
<center>From 'Riverside Literature Series': 1891, by Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co.</center>
<br>
<h3>I--THE DUCKLING IS BORN</h3>
<br>
<p>It was glorious in the country. It was summer; the cornfields
were yellow, the oats were green, the hay had been put up in stacks
in the green meadows; and the stork went about on his long red
legs, and chattered Egyptian, for this was the language he had
learned from his mother. All around the fields and meadows were
great woods, and in the midst of these woods deep lakes. Yes, it
was right glorious in the country.</p>
<p>In the midst of the sunshine there lay an old farm, with deep
canals about it; and from the wall down to the water grew great
burdocks, so high that little children could stand upright under
the tallest of them. It was just as wild there as in the deepest
wood, and here sat a Duck upon her nest. She had to hatch her
ducklings, but she was almost tired out before the little ones
came; and she seldom had visitors. The other ducks liked better to
swim about in the canals than to run up to sit under a burdock and
gabble with her.</p>
<p>At last one egg-shell after another burst open. "Pip! pip!" each
cried, and in all the eggs there were little things that stuck out
their heads.</p>
<p>"Quack! quack!" said the Duck, and they all came quacking out as
fast as they could, looking all around them under the green leaves;
and the mother let them look as much as they liked, for green is
good for the eye.</p>
<p>"How wide the world is!" said all the young ones; for they
certainly had much more room now than when they were inside the
eggs.</p>
<p>"D'ye think this is all the world?" said the mother. "That
stretches far across the other side of the garden, quite into the
parson's field; but I have never been there yet. I hope you are all
together," and she stood up. "No, I have not all. The largest egg
still lies there. How long is that to last? I am really tired of
it." And so she sat down again.</p>
<p>"Well, how goes it?" asked an old Duck who had come to pay her a
visit.</p>
<p>"It lasts a long time with this one egg," said the Duck who sat
there. "It will not open. Now, only look at the others! They are
the prettiest little ducks I ever saw. They are all like their
father: the rogue, he never comes to see me."</p>
<p>"Let me see the egg which will not burst," said the old Duck.
"You may be sure it is a turkey's egg. I was once cheated in that
way, and had much care and trouble with the young ones, for they
are afraid of the water. Must I say it to you? I could not make
them go in. I quacked, and I clacked, but it was no use. Let me see
the egg. Yes, that's a turkey's egg. Let it lie there, and do you
teach the other children to swim."</p>
<p>"I think I will sit on it a little longer," said the Duck. "I've
sat so long now that I can sit a few days more."</p>
<p>"Just as you please," said the old Duck; and she went away.</p>
<p>At last the great egg burst. "Pip! pip!" said the little one,
and crept forth. He was so big and ugly. The Duck looked at
him.</p>
<p>"It's a very large Duckling," said she. "None of the others
looks like that: it really must be a turkey chick! Well, we shall
soon find out. Into the water shall he go, even if I have to push
him in."</p>
<br>
<h3>II--HOW THE DUCKLING WAS TREATED AT HOME</h3>
<br>
<p>The next day it was bright, beautiful weather; the sun shone on
all the green burdocks. The Mother-Duck, with all her family, went
down to the canal. Splash! she jumped into the water. "Quack!
quack!" she said, and one duckling after another plumped in. The
water closed over their heads, but they came up in an instant, and
swam off finely; their legs went of themselves, and they were all
in the water; even the ugly gray Duckling swam with them.</p>
<p>"No, it's not a turkey," said she: "look how well he uses his
legs, how straight he holds himself. It is my own child! On the
whole he's quite pretty, when one looks at him rightly. Quack!
quack! come now with me, and I'll lead you out into the world, and
present you in the duck-yard; but keep close to me all the time, so
that no one may tread on you, and look out for the cats."</p>
<p>And so they came into the duck-yard. There was a terrible row
going on in there, for two families were fighting about an eel's
head, and so the cat got it.</p>
<p>"See, that's the way it goes in the world!" said the
Mother-Duck; and she whetted her beak, for she too wanted the eel's
head. "Only use your legs," she said. "See that you can bustle
about, and bend your necks before the old Duck yonder. She's the
grandest of all here; she's of Spanish blood--that's why she's so
fat; and do you see? she has a red rag around her leg; that's
something very, very fine, and the greatest mark of honor a duck
can have: it means that one does not want to lose her, and that
she's known by the animals and by men too. Hurry! hurry!--don't
turn in your toes, a well brought-up duck turns it's toes quite
out, just like father and mother,--so! Now bend your necks and say
'Quack!'"</p>
<p>And they did so; but the other ducks round about looked at them,
and said quite boldly,--"Look there! now we're to have this crowd
too! as if there were not enough of us already! And--fie!--how that
Duckling yonder looks: we won't stand that!" And at once one Duck
flew at him, and bit him in the neck.</p>
<p>"Let him alone," said the mother: "he is not doing anything to
any one."</p>
<p>"Yes, but he's too large and odd," said the Duck who had bitten
him, "and so he must be put down."</p>
<p>"Those are pretty children the mother has," said the old Duck
with the rag round her leg. "They're all pretty but that one; that
is rather unlucky. I wish she could have that one over again."</p>
<p>"That cannot be done, my lady," said the Mother-Duck. "He is not
pretty, but he has a really good temper, and swims as well as any
of the others; yes, I may even say it, a little better. I think he
will grow up pretty, perhaps in time he will grow a little smaller;
he lay too long in the egg, and therefore he has not quite the
right shape." And she pinched him in the neck, and smoothed his
feathers. "Besides, he is a drake," she said, "and so it does not
matter much. I think he will be very strong: he makes his way
already."</p>
<p>"The other ducklings are graceful enough," said the old Duck.
"Make yourself at home; and if you find an eel's head, you may
bring it to me."</p>
<p>And now they were at home. But the poor Duckling who had crept
last out of the egg, and looked so ugly, was bitten and pushed and
made fun of, as much by the ducks as by the chickens.</p>
<p>"He is too big!" they all said. And the turkey-cock, who had
been born with spurs, and so thought he was an emperor, blew
himself up, like a ship in full sail, and bore straight down upon
him; then he gobbled and grew quite red in the face. The poor
Duckling did not know where he dared stand or walk; he was quite
unhappy because he looked ugly, and was the sport of the whole
duck-yard.</p>
<p>So it went on the first day; and then it grew worse and worse.
The poor Duckling was hunted about by every one; even his brothers
and sisters were quite angry with him, and said, "If the cat would
only catch you, you ugly creature!" And the ducks bit him, and the
chickens beat him, and the girl who had to feed the poultry kicked
at him with her foot.</p>
<br>
<h3>III--OUT ON THE MOOR</h3>
<br>
<p>Then he ran and flew over the fence, and the little birds in the
bushes flew up in fear.</p>
<p>"That is because I am so ugly!" thought the Duckling; and he
shut his eyes, but flew on further; and so he came out into the
great moor, where the wild ducks lived. Here he lay the whole night
long, he was so tired and sad.</p>
<p>Toward morning the wild ducks flew up, and looked at their new
mate.</p>
<p>"What sort of a one are you?" they asked; and the Duckling
turned about to each, and bowed as well as he could. "You are
really very ugly!" said the Wild Ducks. "But that is all the same
to us, so long as you do not marry into our family."</p>
<p>Poor thing! he certainly did not think of marrying, and only
dared ask leave to lie among the reeds and drink some of the swamp
water.</p>
<p>There he lay two whole days; then came thither two wild geese,
or, more truly, two wild ganders. It was not long since each had
crept out of an egg, and that's why they were so saucy.</p>
<p>"Listen, comrade," said one of them. "You're so ugly that I like
you. Will you go with us, and become a bird of passage? Near here
is another moor, where are a few sweet lovely wild geese, all
unmarried, and all able to say 'Quack!' You've a chance of making
your fortune, ugly as you are."</p>
<p>"Piff! paff!" sounded through the air; and both the ganders fell
down dead in the reeds, and the water became blood-red. "Piff!
paff!" it sounded again, and the whole flock of wild geese flew up
from the reeds. And then there was another report. A great hunt was
going on. The gunners lay around in the moor, and some were even
sitting up in the branches of the trees, which spread far over the
reeds. The blue smoke rose like clouds in among the dark trees, and
hung over the water; and the hunting dogs came--splash,
splash!--into the mud, and the rushes and reeds bent down on every
side. That was a fright for the poor Duckling! He turned his head
to put it under his wing; and at that very moment a frightful great
dog stood close by the Duckling. His tongue hung far out of his
mouth, and his eyes glared horribly. He put his nose close to the
Duckling, showed his sharp teeth, and--splash, splash!--on he went
without seizing it.</p>
<p>"Oh, Heaven be thanked!" sighed the Duckling. "I am so ugly that
even the dog does not like to bite me!"</p>
<p>And so he lay quite quiet, while the shots rattled through the
reeds and gun after gun was fired. At last, late in the day, all
was still: but the poor little thing did not dare to rise up; he
waited several hours still before he looked around, and then
hurried away out of the moor as fast as he could. He ran on over
field and meadow; there was a storm, so that he had hard work to
get away.</p>
<br>
<h3>IV--IN THE PEASANT'S HUT</h3>
<br>
<p>Towards evening the Duckling came to a peasant's poor little
hut: it was so tumbled down that it did not itself know on which
side it should fall; and that's why it stood up. The storm whistled
around the Duckling in such a way that he had to sit down to keep
from blowing away; and the wind blew worse and worse. Then he
noticed that one of the hinges of the door had given way, and the
door hung so slanting that he could slip through the crack into the
room; and that is what he did.</p>
<p>Here lived an old woman, with her Cat and her Hen. And the Cat,
whom she called Sonnie, could arch his back and purr; he could even
give out sparks--but for that, one had to stroke his fur the wrong
way. The Hen had quite small, short legs, and therefore she was
called Chickabiddy Shortshanks; she laid good eggs, and the woman
loved her as her own child.</p>
<p>In the morning they noticed at once the strange Duckling, and
the Cat began to purr and the Hen to cluck.</p>
<p>"What's this?" said the woman, and looked all around; but she
could not see well, and therefore she thought the Duckling was a
fat duck that had strayed. "This is a rare prize!" she said. "Now I
shall have duck's eggs. I hope it is not a drake. We must try
that."</p>
<p>And so the Duckling was taken on trial for three weeks, but no
eggs came. And the Cat was master of the house, and the Hen was the
lady, and always said "We and the world!" for they thought they
were half the world, and by far the better half. It seemed to the
Duckling that one might have another mind, but the Hen would not
allow it.</p>
<p>"Can you lay eggs?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then will you hold your tongue!"</p>
<p>And the Cat said, "Can you curve your back, and purr, and give
out sparks?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then you will please have no opinion of your own when sensible
folks are speaking!"</p>
<p>And the Duckling sat in a corner and was in low spirits; then he
began to think of the fresh air and the sunshine; and he was seized
with such a strange longing to swim on the water, that he could not
help telling the Hen of it.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking of?" cried the Hen. "You have nothing to
do, that's why you have these fancies. Lay eggs, or purr, and they
will pass over."</p>
<p>"But it is so charming to swim in the water," said the Duckling,
"so nice to feel it go over one's head, and to dive down to the
bottom!"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's a fine thing, truly," said the Hen. "You are clean
gone crazy. Ask the Cat about it,--he's the cleverest thing I
know,--ask him if he likes to swim in the water, or to dive down: I
won't speak about myself. Ask our mistress herself, the old woman;
no one in the world knows more than she. Do you think she wants to
swim, and let the water close above her head?"</p>
<p>"You don't understand me," said the Duckling.</p>
<p>"We don't understand you! Then pray who is to understand you?
You surely don't pretend to be cleverer than the Cat and the
woman--I won't say anything of myself. Don't make a fool of
yourself, child, and thank your Maker for all the good you have.
Are you not come into a warm room, and have you not folks about you
from whom you can learn something? But you are a goose, and it is
not pleasant to have you about. You may believe me, I speak for
your good. I tell you things you won't like, and by that one may
always know one's true friends! Only take care that you learn to
lay eggs, or to purr, and to give out sparks!"</p>
<p>"I think I will go out into the wide world," said the
Duckling.</p>
<p>"Yes, do go," replied the Hen.</p>
<p>And so the Duckling went away. He swam on the water, and dived,
but he was shunned by every creature because he was so ugly.</p>
<br>
<h3>V--WHAT BECAME OF THE DUCKLING</h3>
<br>
<p>Now came the fall of the year. The leaves in the wood turned
yellow and brown; the wind caught them so that they danced about,
and up in the air it was very cold. The clouds hung low, heavy with
hail and snow-flakes, and on the fence stood the raven, crying
"Croak! croak!" for mere cold; yes, one could freeze fast if one
thought about it. The poor little Duckling certainly had not a good
time. One evening--the sun was just going down in fine style--there
came a whole flock of great handsome birds out of the bushes; they
were shining white, with long, supple necks; they were swans. They
uttered a very strange cry, spread forth their glorious great
wings, and flew away from that cold region to warmer lands, to fair
open lakes. They mounted so high, so high! and the ugly Duckling
had such a strange feeling as he saw them! He turned round and
round in the water like a wheel, stretched out his neck towards
them, and uttered a cry, so high, so strange, that he was
frightened as he heard it.</p>
<p>Oh! he could not forget those beautiful, happy birds; and as
soon as he could see them no longer, he dived down to the very
bottom, and when he came up again, he was quite beside himself. He
did not know what the birds were, nor where they were flying to;
but he loved them more than he had ever loved any one. He did not
envy them at all. How could he think of wishing to have such
loveliness as they had? He would have been glad if only the ducks
would have let him be among them--the poor, ugly creature!</p>
<p>And the winter grew so cold, so cold! The Duckling had to swim
about in the water, to keep it from freezing over; but every night
the hole in which he swam about became smaller and smaller. It
froze so hard that the icy cover sounded; and the Duckling had to
use his legs all the time to keep the hole from freezing tight. At
last he became worn out, and lay quite still, and thus froze fast
in the ice.</p>
<p>Early in the morning a peasant came by, and found him there; he
took his wooden shoe, broke the ice to pieces, and carried the
Duckling home to his wife. Then the Duckling came to himself again.
The children wanted to play with him; but he thought they wanted to
hurt him, and in his terror he flew up into the milk-pan, so that
the milk spilled over into the room. The woman screamed and shook
her hand in the air, at which the Duckling flew down into the tub
where they kept the butter, and then into the meal-barrel and out
again. How he looked then! The woman screamed, and struck at him
with the fire tongs; the children tumbled over one another as they
tried to catch the Duckling; and they laughed and they
screamed!--well was it that the door stood open, and the poor
creature was able to slip out between the bushes into the
newly-fallen snow--there he lay quite worn out.</p>
<p>But it would be too sad if I were to tell all the misery and
care which the Duckling had to bear in the hard winter. He lay out
on the moor among the reeds, when the sun began to shine again and
the larks to sing; it was a beautiful spring.</p>
<p>Then all at once the Duckling could flap his wings: they beat
the air more strongly than before, and bore him stoutly away; and
before he well knew it, he found himself in a great garden, where
the elder-trees stood in flower, and bent their long green branches
down to the winding canal, and the lilacs smelt sweet. Oh, here it
was beautiful, fresh, and springlike! and from the thicket came
three glorious white swans; they rustled their wings, and sat
lightly on the water. The Duckling knew the splendid creatures, and
felt a strange sadness.</p>
<p>"I will fly away to them, to the royal birds! and they will beat
me, because I, that am so ugly, dare to come near them. But it is
all the same. Better to be killed by them than to be chased by
ducks, and beaten by fowls, and pushed about by the girl who takes
care of the poultry yard, and to suffer hunger in winter!" And he
flew out into the water, and swam toward the beautiful swans: these
looked at him, and came sailing down upon him with outspread wings.
"Kill me!" said the poor creature, and bent his head down upon the
water, and waited for death. But what saw he in the clear water? He
saw below him his own image; and lo! it was no longer a clumsy
dark-gray bird, ugly and hateful to look at, but--a swan!</p>
<p>It matters nothing if one is born in a duck-yard, if one has
only lain in a swan's egg.</p>
<p>He felt quite glad at all the need and hard times he had borne;
now he could joy in his good luck in all the brightness that was
round him. And the great swans swam round him and stroked him with
their beaks.</p>
<p>Into the garden came little children, who threw bread and corn
into the water; and the youngest cried, "There is a new one!" and
the other children shouted, "Yes, a new one has come!" And they
clapped their hands and danced about, and ran to their father and
mother; and bread and cake were thrown into the water; and they all
said, "The new one is the most beautiful of all! so young and so
handsome!" and the old swans bowed their heads before him.</p>
<p>Then he felt quite ashamed, and hid his head under his wings,
for he did not know what to do; he was so happy, and yet not at all
proud, for a good heart is never proud. He thought how he had been
driven about and mocked and despised; and now he heard them all
saying that he was the most beautiful of all beautiful birds. And
the lilacs bent their branches straight down into the water before
him, and the sun shone warm and mild. Then his wings rustled, he
lifted his slender neck, and cried from the depths of his
heart:--</p>
<p>"I never dreamed of so much happiness when I was the Ugly
Duckling."</p>

<h2>WHAT THE MOON SAW</h2>
<br>
<center>Hear what the Moon told me:--</center>
<p>"I have seen a cadet promoted to be an officer, and dressing
himself for the first time in his gorgeous uniform; I have seen
young girls in bridal attire, and the prince's young bride in her
wedding dress: but I never saw such bliss as that of a little
four-year-old girl whom I watched this evening. She had got a new
blue dress, and a new pink hat. The finery was just put on, and all
were calling for light, for the moonbeams that came through the
window were not bright enough. They wanted very different lights
from that. There stood the little girl, stiff as a doll, keeping
her arms anxiously off her dress, and her fingers stretched wide
apart. Oh! what happiness beamed from her eyes, from her whole
face. 'To-morrow you may go to walk in the dress,' said the mother;
and the little one looked up at her hat and down again at her
dress, and smiled blissfully. 'Mother,' she cried, 'what will the
little dogs think when they see me in all these fine clothes?'"</p>

<h2>THE LOVERS</h2>
<center>From 'Riverside Literature Series': 1891, by Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co.</center>
<br>
<p>The Top and the Ball lay in a drawer among some other toys; and
so the Top said to the Ball:--"Shall we not be lovers, since we
live together in the same drawer?"</p>
<p>But the Ball, which had a coat of morocco leather, and thought
herself as good as any fine lady, had nothing to say to such a
thing. The next day came the little boy who owned the toys: he
painted the Top red and yellow, and drove a brass nail into it; and
the Top looked splendidly when he turned round.</p>
<p>"Look at me!" he cried to the Ball. "What do you say now? Shall
we not be lovers? We go so nicely together? You jump and I dance!
No one could be happier than we two should be."</p>
<p>"Indeed! Do you think so?" said the Ball. "Perhaps you do not
know that my papa and my mamma were morocco slippers, and that I
have a cork inside me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I am made of mahogany," said the Top; "and the mayor
himself turned me. He has a turning-lathe of his own, and it amuses
him greatly."</p>
<p>"Can I depend on that?" asked the Ball.</p>
<p>"May I never be whipped again if it is not true!" replied the
Top.</p>
<p>"You talk well for yourself," said the Ball, "but I cannot do
what you ask. I am as good as half engaged to a swallow: every time
I leap up into the air he sticks his head out of the nest and says,
'Will you? will you?' And now I have silently said 'Yes,' and that
is as good as being half engaged; but I promise I will never forget
you."</p>
<p>"Much good that will do!" said the Top.</p>
<p>And they spoke no more to each other.</p>
<p>Next day the Ball was taken out. The Top saw how she flew high
into the air, like a bird; at last one could no longer see her.
Each time she came back again, but always gave a high leap when she
touched the earth; and that came about either from her longing, or
because she had a cork in her body. The ninth time the Ball stayed
away and did not come back again; and the boy looked and looked,
but she was gone.</p>
<p>"I know very well where she is!" sighed the Top. "She is in the
Swallow's nest, and has married the Swallow!"</p>
<p>The more the Top thought of this, the more he longed for the
Ball. Just because he could not get her, he fell more in love with
her. That she had taken some one else, that was another thing. So
the Top danced around and hummed, but always thought of the Ball,
which grew more and more lovely in his fancy. Thus many years went
by,--and now it was an old love.</p>
<p>And the Top was no longer young. But one day he was gilt all
over; never had he looked so handsome; he was now a golden Top, and
sprang till he hummed again. Yes, that was something! But all at
once he sprang too high, and--he was gone!</p>
<p>They looked and looked, even in the cellar, but he was not to be
found.</p>
<p>Where was he?</p>
<p>He had jumped into the dust-box, where all kinds of things were
lying: cabbage stalks, sweepings, and gravel that had fallen down
from the roof.</p>
<p>"Here's a nice place to lie in! The gilding will soon leave me
here. And what a rabble I've come amongst!"</p>
<p>And then he looked askance at a long cabbage stalk that was much
too near him, and at a curious round thing like an old apple; but
it was not an apple--it was an old Ball, which had lain for years
in the roof-gutter and was soaked through with water.</p>
<p>"Thank goodness, here comes one of us, with whom one can talk!"
said the little Ball, and looked at the gilt Top. "I am really
morocco, sewn by a girl's hands, and have a cork inside me; but no
one would think it to look at me. I was very near marrying a
swallow, but I fell into the gutter on the roof, and have laid
there full five years, and am quite soaked through. That's a long
time, you may believe me, for a young girl."</p>
<p>But the Top said nothing. He thought of his old love; and the
more he heard, the clearer it became to him that this was she. Then
came the servant-girl, and wanted to empty the dust-box. "Aha,
there's a gilt top!" she cried. And so the Top was brought again to
notice and honor, but nothing was heard of the Ball. And the Top
spoke no more of his old love: for that dies away when the beloved
has lain for five years in a gutter and got soaked through; yes,
one does not know her again when one meets her in the dust-box.</p>

<h2>THE SNOW QUEEN</h2>
<center>From 'Riverside Literature Series': 1891, by Houghton,

<br>
<h3>FOURTH STORY--THE PRINCE AND PRINCESS</h3>
<p>Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when just over against
where she sat, a large Crow hopped over the white snow. He had sat
there a long while, looking at her and shaking his head; and now he
said, "Caw! caw! Good day! good day!" He could not say it better;
but he meant well by the little girl, and asked her where she was
going all alone out in the wide world. The word "alone" Gerda
understood quite well, and felt how much lay in it; so she told the
Crow her whole history, and asked if he had not seen Kay.</p>
<p>The Crow nodded very gravely, and said, "It may be--it may
be!"</p>
<p>"What--do you really think so?" cried the little girl; and she
nearly squeezed the Crow to death, so much did she kiss him.</p>
<p>"Gently, gently," said the Crow. "I think I know; I think that
it may be little Kay. But now he has quite forgotten you for the
Princess."</p>
<p>"Does he live with a princess?" asked Gerda.</p>
<p>"Yes,--listen," said the Crow; "but it is hard for me to speak
your language. If you understand the Crow language, I can tell you
better."</p>
<p>"No, I have not learnt it," said Gerda; "but my grandmother
understands it. I wish I had learnt it."</p>
<p>"No matter," said the Crow: "I will tell you as well as I can;
but it will be bad enough." And then he told all he knew.</p>
<p>"In the kingdom where we now are, there lives a princess, who is
vastly clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole
world, and has forgotten them again,--so clever is she. Some time
ago, they say, she was sitting on her throne,--which is no great
fun, after all,--when she began humming an old tune, and it was
just 'Oh, why should I not be married?' 'Come, now, there is
something in that,' said she, and so then she was bound to marry;
but she would have a husband who knew how to give an answer when he
was spoken to,--not one who was good for nothing but to stand and
be looked at, for that is very tiresome. She then had all the
ladies of the court drummed together; and when they heard what she
meant to do, all were well pleased, and said, 'We are quite glad to
hear it: it is the very thing we were thinking of.' You may believe
every word I say," said the Crow, "for I have a tame sweetheart
that hops about in the palace quite freely, and she told me
all.</p>
<p>"The newspapers at once came out with a border of hearts and the
initials of the Princess; and you could read in them that every
good-looking young man was free to come to the palace and speak to
the Princess; and he who spoke in such wise as showed he felt
himself at home there, and talked best, that one the Princess would
choose for her husband.</p>
<p>"Yes--yes," said the Crow, "you may believe it; it is as true as
I am sitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a
hurry, but no one had good luck either on the first or second day.
They could all talk well enough when they were out in the street;
but as soon as they came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard
richly dressed in silver, and the lackeys in gold, on the
staircase, and the large lighted halls, then they were dumb; and
when they stood before the throne on which the Princess was
sitting, all they could do was to repeat the last word she had
said, and she didn't care to hear that again. It was just as if the
people within were under a charm, and had fallen into a trance till
they came out again into the street; for then--oh, then they could
chatter enough. There was a whole row of them from the town gates
to the palace. I was there myself to look on," said the Crow. "They
grew hungry and thirsty; but from the palace they got not so much
as a glass of water. Some of the cleverest, it is true, had taken
bread and butter with them; but none shared it with his neighbor,
for each thought, 'Let him look hungry, and then the Princess won't
have him.'"</p>
<p>"But Kay--little Kay," asked Gerda, "when did he come? Was he
among the number?"</p>
<p>"Give me time! give me time! we are coming to him. It was on the
third day, when a little personage, without horse or carriage, came
marching right boldly up to the palace; his eyes shone like yours,
he had beautiful long hair, but his clothes were very shabby."</p>
<p>"That was Kay," cried Gerda, with a voice of delight. "Oh, now
I've found him!" and she clapped her hands.</p>
<p>"He had a little knapsack at his back," said the Crow.</p>
<p>"No, that was certainly his sled," said Gerda; "for he went away
with his sled."</p>
<p>"That may be," said the Crow; "I did not see him close to; but I
know from my tame sweetheart that when he came into the courtyard
of the palace, and saw the body-guard in silver, and the lackeys on
the staircase in gold, he was not in the least cast down; he nodded
and said to them, 'It must be very tiresome to stand on the stairs;
for my part, I shall go in.' The halls were bright with lights.
Court people and fine folks were walking about on bare feet; it was
all very solemn. His boots creaked, too, very loudly; but still he
was not at all afraid."</p>
<p>"That's Kay, for certain," said Gerda. "I know he had on new
boots; I have heard them creaking in grandmamma's room."</p>
<p>"Yes, they creaked," said the Crow. "And on he went boldly up to
the Princess, who was sitting on a pearl as large as a
spinning-wheel. All the ladies of the court stood about, with their
maids and their maids' maids, and all the gentlemen with their
servants and their servants' servants, who kept a boy; and the
nearer they stood to the door, the prouder they looked. The boy of
the servants' servants, who always goes in slippers, hardly looked
at one, so very proudly did he stand in the doorway."</p>
<p>"It must have been terrible," said little Gerda. "And did Kay
get the Princess?"</p>
<p>"Were I not a Crow, I should have taken the Princess myself,
although I am engaged. It is said he spoke as well as I speak when
I talk crow language; this I learned from my tame sweetheart. He
was bold and nicely behaved; he had not come to woo the Princess,
but only to hear her wisdom. She pleased him and he pleased
her."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, for certain that was Kay," said Gerda. "He was so
clever; he could do sums with fractions. Oh, won't you take me to
the palace?"</p>
<p>"That is very easily said," answered the Crow. "But how are we
to manage it? I'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it; she can
tell us what to do; for so much I must tell you, such a little girl
as you are will never get leave to go in the common way."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I shall," said Gerda: "when Kay hears that I am here,
he will come out at once to fetch me."</p>
<p>"Wait for me here on these steps," said the Crow. He wagged his
head and flew away.</p>
<p>When it grew dark the Crow came back. "Caw! caw!" said he. "I
bring you a great many good wishes from her; and here is a bit of
bread for you. She took it out of the kitchen, where there is bread
enough, and you are hungry, no doubt. It is not possible for you to
enter the palace, for you are barefoot; the guards in silver and
the lackeys in gold would not allow it: but do not cry, you shall
come in still. My sweetheart knows a little back stair that leads
to the chamber, and she knows where she can get the key of it."</p>
<p>And they went into the garden by the broad path, where one leaf
was falling after the other; and when the lights in the palace were
all put out, one after the other, the Crow led little Gerda to the
back door, which stood ajar.</p>
<p>Oh, how Gerda's heart beat with doubt and longing! It was just
as if she had been about to do something wrong; and yet she only
wanted to know if little Kay was there. Yes, he must be there. She
called to mind his clear eyes and his long hair so vividly, she
could quite see him as he used to laugh when they were sitting
under the roses at home. He would surely be glad to see her--to
hear what a long way she had come for his sake; to know how unhappy
all at home were when he did not come back. Oh, what a fright and
what a joy it was!</p>
<p>Now they were on the stairs. A single lamp was burning there;
and on the floor stood the tame Crow, turning her head on every
side and looking at Gerda, who bowed as her grandmother had taught
her to do.</p>
<p>"My intended has told me so much good of you, my dear young
lady," said the tame Crow. "Your Life, as they call it, is very
affecting. If you will take the lamp, I will go before. We will go
straight on, for we shall meet no one."</p>
<p>"I think there is somebody just behind us," said Gerda; and it
rushed past her. It was like shadows on the wall: horses with
flowing manes and thin legs, huntsmen, ladies and gentlemen on
horseback.</p>
<p>"They are only dreams," said the Crow. "They come to fetch the
thoughts of the fine folk to the chase; 'tis well, for now you can
see them asleep all the better. But let me find, when you come to
have honor and fame, that you possess a grateful heart."</p>
<p>"Tut! that's not worth talking about," said the Crow from the
woods.</p>
<p>Now they came into the first hall, which was of rose-colored
satin, with painted flowers on the wall. Here the dreams were
rushing past, but they hurried by so quickly that Gerda could not
see the fine people. One hall was more showy than the other--well
might people be abashed; and at last they came into the
bed-chamber.</p>
<p>The ceiling of the room was like a great palm-tree, with leaves
of glass, of costly glass; and in the middle of the floor, from a
thick golden stalk, hung two beds, each of which was shaped like a
lily. One was white, and in this lay the Princess: the other was
red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for little Kay. She
bent back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck--oh, that was
Kay! She called him quite loud by name, held the lamp toward
him--the dreams rushed again on horseback into the chamber--he
awoke, turned his head, and--it was not little Kay!</p>
<p>The Prince was only like him about the neck; but he was young
and handsome. And out of the white lily leaves the Princess peeped
too, and asked what was the matter. Then little Gerda cried and
told her whole history, and all that the Crows had done for
her.</p>
<p>"Poor little thing!" said the Prince and the Princess, and they
praised the Crows very much, and told them they were not at all
angry with them, but they were not to do so again. However, they
should have a reward.</p>
<p>"Will you fly about at liberty?" asked the Princess; "or would
you like to have a steady place as court Crows with all the broken
bits from the kitchen?"</p>
<p>And both the Crows nodded, and begged for a steady place; for
they thought of their old age, and said "it was a good thing to
have something for the old folks," as the saying is.</p>
<p>And the Prince got up and let Gerda sleep in his bed, and more
than this he could not do. She folded her little hands, and
thought, "How good men and animals are!" and then she shut her eyes
and slept soundly. All the dreams came flying in again, and they
now looked like the angels; they drew a little sled, on which Kay
sat and nodded his head: but the whole was only a dream, and so it
was all gone as soon as she awoke.</p>
<p>The next day she was dressed from top to toe in silk and velvet.
They offered to let her stay at the palace, and lead a happy life;
but she begged only to have a little carriage with a horse in
front, and for a small pair of shoes; then, she said, she would
again go forth in the wide world and look for Kay.</p>
<p>And she got both shoes and a muff; she was dressed very nicely,
too; and when she was about to set off, a new carriage stopped
before the door. It was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince
and Princess shone like a star upon it; the coachman, the footmen,
and the outriders, for outriders were there too, all wore golden
crowns. The Prince and Princess helped her into the carriage
themselves, and wished her good luck. The Crow of the woods, who
was now married, went with her for the first three miles. He sat
beside Gerda, for he could not bear riding backward; the other Crow
stood in the doorway, and flapped her wings; she could not go with
Gerda, because she suffered from headache since she had had a
steady place, and ate so much. The carriage was lined inside with
sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and cookies.</p>
<p>"Good-by! good-by!" cried Prince and Princess; and little Gerda
wept, and the Crows wept. Thus passed the first miles; and then the
Crow said good-by, and this was the worst good-by of all. He flew
into a tree, and beat his black wings as long as he could see the
carriage, that shone from afar like the clear sunlight.</p>

<h2>THE NIGHTINGALE</h2>
<center>From 'Riverside Literature Series': 1891, by Houghton,
Mifflin &amp; Co.</center>
<br>
<h3>I--THE REAL NIGHTINGALE</h3>
<br>
<p>In China, you must know, the Emperor is a Chinaman, and all whom
he has about him are Chinamen too. It happened a good many years
ago, but that's just why it's worth while to hear the story before
it is forgotten.</p>
<p>The Emperor's palace was the most splendid in the world. It was
made wholly of fine porcelain, very costly, but so brittle and so
hard to handle that one had to take care how one touched it. In the
garden were to be seen the most wonderful flowers, and to the
prettiest of them silver bells were tied, which tinkled, so that
nobody should pass by without noticing the flowers.</p>
<p>Yes, everything in the Emperor's garden was nicely set out, and
it reached so far that the gardener himself did not know where the
end was. If a man went on and on, he came into a glorious forest
with high trees and deep lakes. The wood went straight down to the
sea, which was blue and deep; great ships could sail to and fro
beneath the branches of the trees; and in the trees lived a
Nightingale, which sang so finely that even the poor Fisherman, who
had many other things to do, stopped still and listened, when he
had gone out at night to throw out his nets, and heard the
Nightingale.</p>
<p>"How beautiful that is!" he said; but he had to attend to his
work, and so he forgot the bird. But the next night, when the bird
sang again, and the Fisherman heard it, he said as before, "How
beautiful that is!"</p>
<p>From all the countries of the world travelers came to the city
of the Emperor, and admired it, and the palace, and the garden; but
when they heard the Nightingale, they all said, "That is the best
of all!"</p>
<p>And the travelers told of it when they came home; and the
learned men wrote many books about the town, the palace, and the
garden. But they did not forget the Nightingale; that was spoken of
most of all; and all those who were poets wrote great poems about
the Nightingale in the wood by the deep lake.</p>
<p>The books went all over the world, and a few of them once came
to the Emperor. He sat in his golden chair, and read, and read;
every moment he nodded his head, for it pleased him to hear the
fine things that were said about the city, the palace, and the
garden. "But the Nightingale is the best of all!"--it stood written
there.</p>
<p>"What's that?" exclaimed the Emperor. "The Nightingale? I don't
know that at all! Is there such a bird in my empire, and in my
garden to boot? I've never heard of that. One has to read about
such things."</p>
<p>Hereupon he called his Cavalier, who was so grand that if any
one lower in rank than he dared to speak to him, or to ask him any
question, he answered nothing but "P!"--and that meant nothing.</p>
<p>"There is said to be a strange bird here called a Nightingale!"
said the Emperor. "They say it is the best thing in all my great
empire. Why has no one ever told me anything about it?"</p>
<p>"I have never heard it named," replied the Cavalier. "It has
never been presented at court."</p>
<p>"I command that it shall come here this evening, and sing before
me," said the Emperor. "All the world knows what I have, and I do
not know it myself!"</p>
<p>"I have never heard it mentioned," said the Cavalier. "I will
seek for it. I will find it."</p>
<p>But where was it to be found? The Cavalier ran up and down all
the stairs, through halls and passages, but no one among all those
whom he met had heard talk of the Nightingale. And the Cavalier ran
back to the Emperor, and said that it must be a fable made up by
those who write books.</p>
<p>"Your Imperial Majesty must not believe what is written. It is
fiction, and something that they call the black art."</p>
<p>"But the book in which I read this," said the Emperor, "was sent
to me by the high and mighty Emperor of Japan, and so it cannot be
a falsehood. I will hear the Nightingale! It must be here this
evening! It has my high favor; and if it does not come, all the
court shall be trampled upon after it has supped!"</p>
<p>"Tsing-pe!" said the Cavalier; and again he ran up and down all
the stairs, and through all the halls and passages, and half the
court ran with him, for the courtiers did not like being trampled
upon. There was a great inquiry after the wonderful Nightingale,
which all the world knew, but not the people at court.</p>
<p>At last they met with a poor little girl in the kitchen. She
said:--</p>
<p>"The Nightingale? I know it well; yes, how it can sing! Every
evening I get leave to carry my poor sick mother the scraps from
the table. She lives down by the beach, and when I get back and am
tired, and rest in the wood, then I hear the Nightingale sing. And
then the tears come into my eyes, and it is just as if my mother
kissed me!"</p>
<p>"Little Kitchen-girl," said the Cavalier, "I will get you a
fixed place in the kitchen, with leave to see the Emperor dine, if
you will lead us to the Nightingale, for it is promised for this
evening."</p>
<p>So they all went out into the wood where the Nightingale was
wont to sing; half the court went out. When they were on the way, a
cow began to low.</p>
<p>"Oh!" cried the court pages, "now we have it! That shows a great
power in so small a creature! We have certainly heard it
before."</p>
<p>"No, those are cows mooing!" said the little Kitchen-girl. "We
are a long way from the place yet."</p>
<p>Now the frogs began to croak in the marsh.</p>
<p>"Glorious!" said the Chinese Court Preacher. "Now I hear it--it
sounds just like little church bells."</p>
<p>"No, those are frogs!" said the little Kitchen-maid. "But now I
think we shall soon hear it."</p>
<p>And then the Nightingale began to sing.</p>
<p>"That is it!" exclaimed the little Girl. "Listen, listen! and
yonder it sits."</p>
<p>And she pointed to a little gray bird up in the boughs.</p>
<p>"Is it possible?" cried the Cavalier. "I should never have
thought it looked like that! How simple it looks! It must certainly
have lost its color at seeing so many famous people around."</p>
<p>"Little Nightingale!" called the little Kitchen-maid, quite
loudly, "our gracious Emperor wishes you to sing before him."</p>
<p>"With the greatest pleasure!" replied the Nightingale, and sang
so that it was a joy to hear it.</p>
<p>"It sounds just like glass bells!" said the Cavalier. "And look
at its little throat, how it's working! It's wonderful that we
should never have heard it before. That bird will be a great
success at court."</p>
<p>"Shall I sing once more before the Emperor?" asked the
Nightingale, for it thought the Emperor was present.</p>
<p>"My excellent little Nightingale," said the Cavalier, "I have
great pleasure in inviting you to a court festival this evening,
when you shall charm his Imperial Majesty with your beautiful
singing."</p>
<p>"My song sounds best in the greenwood!" replied the Nightingale;
still it came willingly when it heard what the Emperor wished.</p>
<p>In the palace there was a great brushing up. The walls and the
floor, which were of porcelain, shone with many thousand golden
lamps. The most glorious flowers, which could ring clearly, had
been placed in the halls. There was a running to and fro, and a
draught of air, but all the bells rang so exactly together that one
could not hear any noise.</p>
<p>In the midst of the great hall, where the Emperor sat, a golden
perch had been placed, on which the Nightingale was to sit. The
whole court was there, and the little Cook-maid had leave to stand
behind the door, as she had now received the title of a real
cook-maid. All were in full dress, and all looked at the little
gray bird, to which the Emperor nodded.</p>
<p>And the Nightingale sang so gloriously that the tears came into
the Emperor's eyes, and the tears ran down over his cheeks; and
then the Nightingale sang still more sweetly; that went straight to
the heart. The Emperor was happy, and he said the Nightingale
should have his golden slipper to wear round its neck. But the
Nightingale thanked him, it had already got reward enough.</p>
<p>"I have seen tears in the Emperor's eyes--that is the real
treasure to me. An Emperor's tears have a strange power. I am paid
enough!" Then it sang again with a sweet, glorious voice.</p>
<p>"That's the most lovely way of making love I ever saw!" said the
ladies who stood round about, and then they took water in their
mouths to gurgle when any one spoke to them. They thought they
should be nightingales too. And the lackeys and maids let it be
known that they were pleased too; and that was saying a good deal,
for they are the hardest of all to please. In short, the
Nightingale made a real hit.</p>
<p>It was now to remain at court, to have its own cage, with
freedom to go out twice every day and once at night. It had twelve
servants, and they all had a silken string tied to the bird's leg
which they held very tight. There was really no pleasure in going
out.</p>
<p>The whole city spoke of the wonderful bird, and when two people
met, one said nothing but "Nightin," and the other said "gale"; and
then they sighed, and understood one another. Eleven storekeepers'
children were named after the bird, but not one of them could sing
a note.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>II--THE TOY NIGHTINGALE</h3>
<br>
<p>One day a large parcel came to the Emperor, on which was written
"The Nightingale."</p>
<p>"Here we have a new book about this famous bird," said the
Emperor.</p>
<p>But it was not a book: it was a little work of art, that lay in
a box; a toy nightingale, which was to sing like a live one, but it
was all covered with diamonds, rubies, and sapphires. So soon as
the toy bird was wound up, he could sing one of the pieces that the
real one sang, and then his tail moved up and down, and shone with
silver and gold. Round his neck hung a little ribbon, and on that
was written, "The Emperor of Japan's Nightingale is poor beside
that of the Emperor in China."</p>
<p>"That is capital!" said they all, and he who had brought the toy
bird at once got the title Imperial Head-Nightingale-Bringer.</p>
<p>"Now they must sing together: what a duet that will be!"</p>
<p>And so they had to sing together; but it did not sound very
well, for the real Nightingale sang in its own way, and the toy
bird sang waltzes.</p>
<p>"That's not its fault," said the Play-master: "it's quite
perfect, and very much in my style."</p>
<p>Now the toy bird was to sing alone. It made just as much of a
hit as the real one, and then it was so much more fine to look
at--it shone like bracelets and breastpins.</p>
<p>Three-and-thirty times over did it sing the same piece, and yet
was not tired. The people would gladly have heard it again, but the
Emperor said that the living Nightingale ought to sing a little
something. But where was it? No one had noticed that it had flown
away, out of the open window, back to its green woods.</p>
<p>"But what is become of it?" asked the Emperor.</p>
<p>Then all the courtiers scolded, and thought the Nightingale was
a very thankless creature.</p>
<p>"We have the best bird, after all," said they.</p>
<p>And so the toy bird had to sing again, and this was the
thirty-fourth time they had listened to the same piece. For all
that, they did not know it quite by heart, for it was so very
difficult. And the Play-master praised the bird highly; yes, he
declared that it was better than the real Nightingale, not only in
its feathers and its many beautiful diamonds, but inside as
well.</p>
<p>"For you see, ladies and gentlemen, and above all, your Imperial
Majesty, with the real Nightingale one can never make sure what is
coming, but in this toy bird everything is settled. It is just so,
and not any other way. One can explain it; one can open it, and can
show how much thought went to making it, where the waltzes come
from, how they go, and how one follows another."</p>
<p>"Those are quite our own ideas," they all said. And the
Play-master got leave to show the bird to the people on the next
Sunday. The people were to hear it sing too, said the Emperor; and
they did hear it, and were as much pleased as if they had all had
tea, for that's quite the Chinese fashion; and they all said "Oh!"
and held their forefingers up in the air and nodded. But the poor
Fisherman, who had heard the real Nightingale, said:--</p>
<p>"It sounds pretty enough, and it's a little like, but there's
something wanting, though I know not what!"</p>
<p>The real Nightingale was exiled from the land and empire.</p>
<p>The toy bird had its place on a silken cushion close to the
Emperor's bed. All the presents it had received, gold and precious
stones, were ranged about it. In title it had come to be High
Imperial After-Dinner-Singer, and in rank it was Number One on the
left hand; for the Emperor reckoned that side the most important on
which the heart is placed, and even in an Emperor the heart is on
the left side. And the Play-master wrote a work of five-and-twenty
volumes about the toy bird: it was so learned and so long, full of
the most difficult Chinese words, that all the people said they had
read it and understood it, or else they would have been thought
stupid, and would have had their bodies trampled on.</p>
<p>So a whole year went by. The Emperor, the court, and all the
other Chinese knew every little twitter in the toy bird's song by
heart. But just for that reason it pleased them best--they could
sing with it themselves, and they did so. The street boys sang,
"Tsi-tsi-tsi-glug-glug!" and the Emperor himself sang it too. Yes,
that was certainly famous.</p>
<p>But one evening, when the toy bird was singing its best, and the
Emperor lay in bed and heard it, something inside the bird said,
"Svup!" Something cracked. "Whir-r-r!" All the wheels ran round,
and then the music stopped.</p>
<p>The Emperor jumped at once out of bed, and had his own doctor
called; but what could he do? Then they sent for a watchmaker, and
after a good deal of talking and looking, he got the bird into some
sort of order; but he said that it must be looked after a good
deal, for the barrels were worn, and he could not put new ones in
in such a manner that the music would go. There was a great to-do;
only once in a year did they dare to let the bird sing, and that
was almost too much. But then the Play-master made a little speech,
full of heavy words, and said this was just as good as before--and
so, of course, it was as good as before.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>III--THE REAL NIGHTINGALE AGAIN</h3>
<br>
<p>Five years had gone by, and a real grief came upon the whole
nation. The Chinese were really fond of their Emperor, and now he
was sick, and could not, it was said, live much longer. Already a
new Emperor had been chosen, and the people stood out in the street
and asked the Cavalier how their old Emperor did.</p>
<p>"P!" said he, and shook his head.</p>
<p>Cold and pale lay the Emperor in his great, gorgeous bed; the
whole court thought him dead, and each one ran to pay respect to
the new ruler. The chamberlains ran out to talk it over, and the
ladies'-maids had a great coffee party. All about, in all the halls
and passages, cloth had been laid down so that no one could be
heard go by, and therefore it was quiet there, quite quiet. But the
Emperor was not dead yet: stiff and pale he lay on the gorgeous bed
with the long velvet curtains and the heavy gold tassels; high up,
a window stood open, and the moon shone in upon the Emperor and the
toy bird.</p>
<p>The poor Emperor could scarcely breathe; it was just as if
something lay upon his breast. He opened his eyes, and then he saw
that it was Death who sat upon his breast, and had put on his
golden crown, and held in one hand the Emperor's sword, and in the
other his beautiful banner. And all around, from among the folds of
the splendid velvet curtains, strange heads peered forth; a few
very ugly, the rest quite lovely and mild. These were all the
Emperor's bad and good deeds, that stood before him now that Death
sat upon his heart.</p>
<p>"Do you remember this?" whispered one to the other, "Do you
remember that?" and then they told him so much that the sweat ran
from his forehead.</p>
<p>"I did not know that!" said the Emperor. "Music! music! the
great Chinese drum!" he cried, "so that I need not hear all they
say!"</p>
<p>And they kept on, and Death nodded like a Chinaman to all they
said.</p>
<p>"Music! music!" cried the Emperor. "You little precious golden
bird, sing, sing! I have given you gold and costly presents; I have
even hung my golden slipper around your neck--now, sing!"</p>
<p>But the bird stood still,--no one was there to wind him up, and
he could not sing without that; but Death kept on staring at the
Emperor with his great hollow eyes, and it was quiet, fearfully
quiet.</p>
<p>Then there sounded close by the window the most lovely song. It
was the little live Nightingale, that sat outside on a spray. It
had heard of the Emperor's need, and had come to sing to him of
trust and hope. And as it sang the spectres grew paler and paler;
the blood ran more and more quickly through the Emperor's weak
limbs, and Death himself listened, and said:--</p>
<p>"Go on, little Nightingale, go on!"</p>
<p>"But will you give me that splendid golden sword? Will you give
me that rich banner? Will you give me the Emperor's crown?"</p>
<p>And Death gave up each of these treasures for a song. And the
Nightingale sang on and on; it sang of the quiet churchyard where
the white roses grow, where the elder-blossom smells sweet, and
where the fresh grass is wet with the tears of mourners. Then Death
felt a longing to see his garden, and floated out at the window in
the form of a cold, white mist.</p>
<p>"Thanks! thanks!" said the Emperor. "You heavenly little bird! I
know you well. I drove you from my land and empire, and yet you
have charmed away the evil faces from my bed, and driven Death from
my heart! How can I pay you?"</p>
<p>"You have paid me!" replied the Nightingale. "I drew tears from
your eyes, the first time I sang--I shall never forget that. Those
are the jewels that make a singer's heart glad. But now sleep and
grow fresh and strong again. I will sing you something."</p>
<p>And it sang, and the Emperor fell into a sweet sleep. Ah! how
mild and refreshing that sleep was! The sun shone upon him through
the windows, when he awoke strong and sound. Not one of his
servants had yet come back, for they all thought that he was dead;
but the Nightingale still sat beside him and sang.</p>
<p>"You must always stay with me," said the Emperor. "You shall
sing as you please; and I'll break the toy bird into a thousand
pieces."</p>
<p>"Not so," replied the Nightingale. "It did well as long as it
could; keep it as you have done till now. I cannot build my nest in
the palace to dwell in it, but let me come when I feel the wish;
then I will sit in the evening on the spray yonder by the window,
and sing for you, so that you may be glad and thoughtful at once. I
will sing of those who are happy and of those who suffer. I will
sing of good and of evil that remain hidden round about you. The
little singing bird flies far around, to the poor fisherman, to the
peasant's roof, to every one who dwells far away from you and from
your court. I love your heart more than your crown, and yet the
crown has an air of sanctity about it. I will come and sing to
you--but one thing you must promise me."</p>
<p>"Everything!" said the Emperor; and he stood there in his royal
robes, which he had put on himself, and pressed the sword which was
heavy with gold to his heart.</p>
<p>"One thing I beg of you: tell no one that you have a little bird
who tells you everything. Then all will go well."</p>
<p>And the Nightingale flew away.</p>
<p>The servants came in to look on their dead Emperor, and--yes,
there he stood, and the Emperor said, "Good-morning!"</p>

<h2>THE MARKET PLACE AT ODENSE (1836)</h2>
<center>From 'The Story of My Life'</center>
<br>
<p>If the reader was a child who lived in Odense, he would just
need to say the words "St. Knud's Fair," and it would rise before
him in the brightest colors, lighted by the beams of childish
fancy.... Somewhere near the middle of the town, five streets meet
and make a little square.... There the town crier, in striped
homespun, with a yellow bandoleer, beat his drum and proclaimed
from a scroll the splendid things to be seen in the town.</p>
<p>"He beats a good drum," said the chamberlain.</p>
<p>"It would delight Spontini and Rossini to hear the fellow," said
William. "Really, Odense at New Year would just suit these
composers. The drums and fifes are in their glory. They drum the
New Year in. Seven or eight little drummers, or fifers, go from
door to door, with troops of children and old women, and they beat
the drum-taps and the reveille. That fetches the pennies. Then when
the New Year is well drummed in the city, they go into the country
and drum for meat and porridge. The drumming in of the New Year
lasts until Lent."</p>
<p>"And then we have new sports," said the chamberlain. "The
fishers come from Stege with a full band, and on their shoulders a
boat with all sorts of flags.... Then they lay a board between two
boats, and on this two of the youngest and spryest wrestle till one
falls into the water.... But all the fun's gone now. When I was
young, there was different sport going. That was a sight! the
corporation procession with the banners and the harlequin atop, and
at Shrovetide, when the butchers led about an ox decked with
ribbons and carnival twigs, with a boy on his back with wings and a
little shirt.... All that's past now, people are got so fine. St.
Knud's Fair is not what it used to be."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm glad it isn't," said William; "but let us go into the
market and look at the Jutlanders, who are sitting with their
pottery amidst the hay."</p>
<p>Just as the various professions in the Middle Ages had each its
quarter, so here the shoemakers had ranged their tables side by
side, and behind them stood the skillful workman in his long coat,
and with his well-brushed felt hat in his hand. Where the
shoemakers' quarter ended, the hatters' began, and there one was in
the midst of the great market where tents and booths formed many
parallel streets. The milliners, the goldsmiths, the pastry cooks,
with booths of canvas and wood, were the chief attractions. Ribbons
and handkerchiefs fluttered. Noise and bustle was everywhere. The
girls from the same village always went in rows, seven or eight
inseparables, with hands fast clasped. It was impossible to break
the chain; and if you tried to pass through, the whole band wound
itself into a clump. Behind the booth was a great space with wooden
shoes, pottery, turners' and saddlers' wares. Rude and rough toys
were spread on tables. Around them children were trying little
trumpets, or moving about the playthings. Country girls twirled and
twisted the work-boxes and themselves many a time before making
their bargain. The air was thick and heavy with odors that were
spiced with the smell of honey-cake.</p>
<p>On Fair day, St. Knud's Church and all its tombs are open to the
public. From whatever side you look at this fine old building it
has something imposing, with its high tower and spire. The interior
produces the same, perhaps a greater, effect. But its full
impression is not felt on entering it, nor until you get to the
main aisle. There all is grand, beautiful, light. The whole
interior is bright with gilding. Up in the high vaulted roof there
shine, since old time, a multitude of golden stars. On both sides,
high up above the side aisles, are great gothic windows from which
the light streams down. The side aisles are painted with oil
portraits, whole families, women and children, all in clerical
dress, with long gowns and deep ruffs. Usually the figures are
ranged by ages, the eldest first and then down to the very
smallest.</p>
<p>They all stand with folded hands, and look piously down before
them, till their colors have gradually faded away in dust.</p>

<br>
<h2>THE ANDERSEN JUBILEE AT ODENSE</h2>
<center>From 'The Story of My Life'</center>
<br>
<p>I heard on the morning of December 6th [1867] that the town was
decorated, that all the schools had a holiday, because it was my
festival. I felt myself as humble, meek, and poor as though I stood
before my God. Every weakness or error or sin, in thought, word,
and deed, was revealed to me. All stood out strangely clear in my
soul, as though it were doomsday--and it was my festival. God knows
how humble I felt when men exalted and honored me so.</p>
<p>Then came the first telegram from the Student Club. I saw that
they shared and did not envy my joy. Then came a dispatch from a
private club of students in Copenhagen, and from the Artisans' Club
of Slagelse. You will remember that I went to school in that town,
and was therefore attached to it. Soon followed messages from
sympathetic friends in Aarhuus, in Stege; telegram on telegram from
all around. One of these was read aloud by Privy Councillor Koch.
It was from the king. The assembly burst out in applause. Every
cloud and shadow in my soul vanished!</p>
<p>How happy I was! And yet man must not exalt himself. I was to
feel that I was only a poor child of humanity, bound by the frailty
of earth. I suffered from a dreadful toothache, which was increased
unbearably by the heat and excitement. Yet at evening I read a
Wonder Story for the little friends. Then the deputation came from
the town corporations, with torches and waving banners through the
street, to the guild-hall. And now the prophecy was to be fulfilled
that the old woman gave when I left home as a boy. Odense was to be
illuminated for me. I stepped to the open window. All was aglow
with torchlight, the square was filled with people. Songs swelled
up to me. I was overcome, emotionally. Physically racked with pain,
I could not enjoy this crowning fruit of my life, the toothache was
so intolerable. The ice-cold air that blew against me fanned the
pain to an awful intensity, and, instead of enjoying the bliss of
these never-to-be-repeated moments, I looked at the printed song to
see how many verses had to be sung before I could step away from
the torture which the cold air sent through my teeth. It was the
acme of suffering. As the glow of the piled-up torches subsided, my
pain subsided too. How thankful I was, though! Gentle eyes were
fastened upon me all around. All wanted to speak with me, to press
my hand. Tired out, I reached the bishop's house and sought rest.
But I got no sleep till toward morning, so filled and overflowing
was I.</p>

<br>
<h2>'MISERERE' IN THE SIXTINE CHAPEL</h2>
<center>From 'The Improvisatore': Translation by Mary
Howitt</center>
<br>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon began the Miserere in the Sixtine Chapel.
My soul longed for music; in the world of melody I could find
sympathy and consolation. The throng was great, even within the
chapel--the foremost division was already filled with ladies.
Magnificent boxes, hung with velvet and golden draperies for royal
personages and foreigners from various courts, were here erected so
high that they looked out beyond the richly carved railing which
separated the ladies from the interior of the chapel. The papal
Swiss Guards stood in their bright festal array. The officers wore
light armor, and in their helmets a waving plume.... The old
cardinals entered in their magnificent scarlet velvet cloaks, with
their white ermine capes, and seated themselves side by side in a
great half-circle within the barrier, while the priests who had
carried their trains seated themselves at their feet. By the little
side door of the altar the holy father now entered, in his scarlet
mantle and silver tiara. He ascended his throne. Bishops swung the
vessels of incense around him, while young priests, in scarlet
vestments, knelt, with lighted torches in their hands, before him
and the high altar.</p>
<p>The reading of the lessons began. But it was impossible to keep
the eyes fixed on the lifeless letters of the Missal--they raised
themselves, with the thoughts, to the vast universe which Michael
Angelo has breathed forth in colors upon the ceiling and the walls.
I contemplated his mighty sibyls and wondrously glorious
prophets,--every one of them a subject for a painting. My eyes
drank in the magnificent processions, the beautiful groups of
angels; they were not, to me, painted pictures;--all stood living
before me. The rich tree of knowledge, from which Eve gave the
fruit to Adam; the Almighty God, who floated over the waters,--not
borne up by angels, as the older masters had represented him--no,
the company of angels rested upon him and his fluttering garments.
It is true, I had seen these pictures before, but never as now had
they seized upon me. My excited state of mind, the crowd of people,
perhaps even the lyric of my thoughts, made me wonderfully alive to
poetical impressions; and many a poet's heart has felt as mine
did!</p>
<p>The bold foreshortenings, the determinate force with which every
figure steps forward, is amazing, and carries one quite away! It is
a spiritual Sermon on the Mount, in color and form. Like Raphael,
we stand in astonishment before the power of Michael Angelo. Every
prophet is a Moses, like that which he formed in marble. What giant
forms are those which seize upon our eye and our thoughts as we
enter! But when intoxicated with this view, let us turn our eyes to
the background of the chapel, whose whole wall is a high altar of
art and thought. The great chaotic picture, from the floor to the
roof, shows itself there like a jewel, of which all the rest is
only the setting. We see there the Last Judgment.</p>
<p>Christ stands in judgment upon the clouds, and his Mother and
the Apostles stretch forth their hands beseechingly for the poor
human race. The dead raise the gravestones under which they have
lain; blessed spirits adoring, float upward to God, while the abyss
seizes its victims. Here one of the ascending spirits seeks to save
his condemned brother, whom the abyss already embraces in its snaky
folds. The children of despair strike their clenched fists upon
their brows, and sink into the depths! In bold foreshortenings,
float and tumble whole legions between heaven and earth. The
sympathy of the angels, the expression of lovers who meet, the
child that at the sound of the trumpet clings to the mother's
breast, are so natural and beautiful that one believes one's self
to be among those who are waiting for judgment. Michael Angelo has
expressed in colors what Dante saw and has sung to the generations
of the earth.</p>
<p>The descending sun at that moment threw his last beams in
through the uppermost window. Christ, and the blessed around him,
were strongly lighted up; while the lower part, where the dead
arose, and the demons thrust their boat laden with the damned from
the shore, were almost in darkness.</p>
<p>Just as the sun went down the last lesson was ended, the last
light which now remained was extinguished, and the whole picture
world vanished in the gloom from before me; but in that same moment
burst forth music and singing. That which color had bodily revealed
arose now in sound; the day of judgment, with its despair and its
exultation, resounded above us.</p>
<p>The father of the church, stripped of his papal pomp, stood
before the altar, and prayed to the holy cross; and upon the wings
of the trumpet resounded the trembling choir, 'Populus meus quid
feci tibi?' Soft angel-tones rose above the deep song, tones which
ascended not from a human breast: it was not a man's nor a woman's;
it belonged to the world of spirits; it was like the weeping of
angels dissolved in melody.</p>

Saxons, Aneurin was famous both as poet and warrior. He sang of the
long struggle that eventually was to turn Briton into England, and
celebrated in his 'Gododin' ninety of the fallen Cymric chiefs. The
notes of his life are scanty, and are drawn chiefly from his
allusion to himself in his poem. He was the son of Cwm Cawlwyd, a
chief of the tribe of Gododin. He seems to have been educated at
St. Cadoc's College at Llancarvan, and afterwards entered the
bardic order. As appears from the 'Gododin,' he was present at the
battle of Cattr&aelig;th both as bard and as priest. He fled, but
was taken prisoner. In his poem he refers to the hardships he
endured in his captivity. After his release he returned to
Llancarvan, Wales, and in his old age he went north to live with
his brother in Galloway. Here he was murdered; his death is
referred to as one of the "three accursed hatchet-strokes of the
isle of Britain." His friendship with Taliessin is commemorated by
both bards.</p>
<p>The 'Gododin' is at once the longest and the most important
composition in early Welsh literature. It has been variously
interpreted, but is thought to celebrate the battle of
Cattr&aelig;th. This battle was fought in 570 between the Britons,
who had formed a league to defend their country, and their Teutonic
invaders. It "began on a Tuesday, lasted for a week, and ended with
great slaughter of the Britons, who fought desperately till they
perished on the field." Three hundred and sixty chieftains were
slain; only three escaped by flight, among whom was Aneurin, who
afterwards commemorated the slaughter in the 'Gododin,' a lament
for the dead. Ninety-seven of the stanzas remain. In various
measures of alliterative and assonant verse they sing the praises
of ninety of the fallen chiefs, usually giving one stanza to each
hero. One of these stanzas is known to readers of Gray, who
translated it under the name of 'The Death of Hoel.'</p>
<p>Again the 'Gododin' is assumed to be, like many early epic poems
whose origin is wrapped in mystery, not the commemoration of one
single, particular event, but a collection of lays composed at
various times, which compresses into one battle the long and
disastrous period of the Anglo-Saxon invasion, ending in the
subjugation of the Britons.</p>
<p>But whatever its history, the 'Gododin' is one of the finest
monuments of Cymric literature. "In the brevity of the narrative,
the careless boldness of the actors as they present themselves, the
condensed energy of the action, and the fierce exultation of the
slaughter, together with the recurring elegiac note, this poem (or
poems if it be the work of two authors) has some of the highest
epic qualities. The ideas and manners are in harmony with the age
and the country to which it is referred."</p>
<p>Like all early songs, the poem was handed down through centuries
by oral tradition. It is now preserved in the 'Book of Aneurin,' a
small quarto manuscript of nineteen leaves of vellum, of the end of
the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>The 'Gododin' has been published with an English translation and
notes by the Rev. J. Williams (1852); and by the Cymmrodorion
Society, with a translation by Thomas Stevens, in 1885. Interesting
information covering it may be found in Skene's 'Four Ancient Books
of Wales' (1866), and in the article 'Celtic Literature' in this
work.</p>

<p>[During the battle a conference was held, at which the British
leaders demanded as a condition of peace that part of the land of
Gododin be restored. In reply, the Saxons killed Owain, one of the
greatest of the Cymric bards. Aneurin thus pictures him:--]</p>
<blockquote>A man in thought, a boy in form,<br>
He stoutly fought, and sought the storm<br>
Of flashing war that thundered far.<br>

his great poem, it is evident that the warriors of whom he sang
fortified themselves, before entering the field of battle, with
unstinted libations of that favorite intoxicant of those days,
sweet mead. He mentions the condition of the warriors as they
started for the fray, and tells of Hoel's fate. This son of Cian
had married the daughter of one of the Bryneish. His marriage
caused no abatement of a feud existing between the tribes to which
the husband and wife respectively belonged. He repudiated her
family, disdained to take her away, and was sought and slain by her
insulted father.]</p>

<h2><a name="ANGLO-SAXON_LITERATURE"></a>ANGLO-SAXON
LITERATURE</h2>
<h3>BY ROBERT SHARP</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he earliest recorded utterances of a race, whether in poetry or
in prose, become to the representatives of this race in later days
a treasure beyond price. The value of such monuments of the remote
past is manifold. In them we first begin to become really
acquainted with ancestors of the people of to-day, even though we
may have read in the pages of earlier writers of alien descent much
that is of great concurrent interest. Through the medium of the
native saga, epic, and meagre chronicle, we see for the first time
their real though dim outlines, moving in and out of the mists that
obscure the dawn of history; and these outlines become more and
more distinct as the literary remains of succeeding periods become
more abundant and present more varied aspects of life. We come
gradually to know what manner of men and women were these
ancestors, what in peace and in war were their customs, what their
family and social relations, their food and drink, their dress,
their systems of law and government, their religion and morals,
what were their art instincts, what were their ideals.</p>
<p>This is essential material for the construction of history in
its complete sense. And this evidence, when subjected to judicious
criticism, is trustworthy; for the ancient story-teller and poet
reflects the customs and ideas and ideals of his own time, even
though the combination of agencies and the preternatural
proportions of the actors and their deeds belong to the
imagination. The historian must know how to supplement and to give
life and interest to the colorless succession of dates, names, and
events of the chronicler, by means of these imaginative yet
truth-bearing creations of the poet.</p>
<p>Remnants of ancient poetry and legend have again an immediate
value in proportion as they exhibit a free play of fine
imagination; that is, according as they possess the power of
stirring to response the aesthetic feeling of subsequent ages,--as
they possess the true poetic quality. This gift of imagination
varies greatly among races as among individuals, and the earliest
manifestations of it frequently throw a clear light upon apparently
eccentric tendencies developed in a literature in later times.</p>
<p>For these reasons, added to a natural family pride in them, the
early literary monuments of the Anglo-Saxons should be cherished by
us as among the most valued possessions of the race.</p>
<p>The first Teutonic language to be reduced to writing was the
Moeso-Gothic. Considerable portions of a translation of the Bible
into that language, made by Bishop Ulfilas in the fourth century,
still remain. But this cannot be called the beginning of a
literature; for there is no trace of original creative impulse. The
Gothic movement, too, seems to have ceased immediately after its
beginning. It is elsewhere that we must seek for the rise of a real
Teutonic literature. We shall not find it till after the lapse of
several centuries; and we find it not among the tribes that
remained in the fatherland, nor with those that had broken into and
conquered parts of the Roman empire, only to be absorbed and to
blend with other races into Romanic nations. The proud distinction
belongs to the Low German tribes that had created an England in
Britain.</p>
<p>The conquest of Britain by the Anglo-Saxons, begun in 449,
seemed at first to promise only retrogression and the ruin of an
existing civilization. These fierce barbarians found among the
Celts of Britain a Roman culture, and the Christian religion
exerting its influence for order and humanity. Their mission seemed
to be to destroy both. In their original homes in the forests of
northern Germany, they had come little if at all into contact with
Roman civilization. At any rate, we may assume that they had felt
no Roman influence capable of stemming their national and ethnical
tendencies. We cannot yet solve the difficult problem of the extent
of their mingling with the conquered Celts in Britain. In spite of
learned opinions to the contrary, the evidence now available seems
to point to only a small infusion of Celtic blood. The conquerors
seem to have settled down to their new homes with all the
heathenism and most of the barbarism they had brought from their
old home, a Teutonic people still.</p>
<p>In these ruthless, plundering barbarians, whose very breath was
battle, and who seemed for the time the very genius of disorder and
ruin, there existed, nevertheless, potentialities of humanity,
order, and enlightenment far exceeding those of the system they
displaced. In all their barbarism there was a certain nobility;
their courage was unflinching; the fidelity, even unto death, of
thane to lord, repaid the open-handed generosity of lord to thane;
they honored truth; and even after we allow for the exaggerated
claims made for a chivalrous devotion that did not exist, we find
that they held their women in higher respect than was usual even
among many more enlightened peoples.</p>
<p>There are few more remarkable narratives in history than that of
the facility and enthusiasm with which the Anglo-Saxons, a people
conservative then as now to the degree of extreme obstinacy,
accepted Christianity and the new learning which followed in the
train of the new religion. After a few lapses into paganism in some
localities, we find these people, who lately had swept Christian
Britain with fire and sword, themselves became most zealous
followers of Christ. Under the influence of the Roman missionaries
who, under St. Augustine, had begun their work in the south in 597
among the Saxons and Jutes, and under the combined influence of
Irish and Roman missionaries in the north and east among the
Angles, theological and secular studies were pursued with avidity.
By the end of the seventh century we find Anglo-Saxon missionaries,
with St. Boniface at their head, carrying Christianity and
enlightenment to the pagan German tribes on the Continent.</p>
<p>The torch had been passed to the Anglo-Saxon, and a new centre
of learning, York,--the old Roman capital, now the chief city of
the Northumbrian Angles,--became famous throughout Europe. Indeed,
York seemed for a time the chief hope for preserving and advancing
Christian culture; for the danger of a relapse into dense ignorance
had become imminent in the rest of Europe. Bede, born about 673, a
product of this Northumbrian culture, represented the highest
learning of his day. He wrote a vast number of works in Latin,
treating nearly all the branches of knowledge existing in his day.
Alcuin, another Northumbrian, born about 735, was called by
Charlemagne to be tutor for himself and his children, and to
organize the educational system of his realm. Other great names
might be added to show the extent and brilliancy of the new
learning. It was more remarkable among the Angles; and only at a
later day, when the great schools of the north had gone up in fire
and smoke in the pitiless invasion of the Northmen, did the West
Saxons become the leaders, almost the only representatives, of the
literary impulse among the Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<p>It is significant that the first written English that we know of
contains the first Christian English king's provision for peace and
order in his kingdom. The laws of Athelbert, King of Kent, who died
in 616, were written down early in the seventh century. This code,
as it exists, is the oldest surviving monument of English prose.
The laws of Ine, King of the West Saxons, were put into writing
about 690. These collections can scarcely be said to have a
literary value; but they are of the utmost importance as throwing
light upon the early customs of our race, and the laws of Ine may
be considered as the foundation of modern English law. Many of
these laws were probably much older; but they were now first
codified and systematically enforced. The language employed is
direct, almost crabbed; but occasionally the Anglo-Saxon love of
figure shows itself. To illustrate, I quote, after Brooke, from
Earle's 'Anglo-Saxon Literature,' page 153:--</p>
<blockquote>"In case any one burn a tree in a wood, and it came to
light who did it, let him pay the full penalty, and give sixty
shillings, <i>because fire is a thief</i>. If one fell in a wood
ever so many trees, and it be found out afterwards, let him pay for
three trees, each with thirty shillings. He is not required to pay
for more of them, however many they may be, <i>because the axe is a
reporter, and not a thief</i>." [The italicized sentences are
evidently current sayings.]</blockquote>
<p>But even these remains, important and interesting as they are,
may not be called the beginning of a vernacular literature. It is
among the Angles of Northumbria that we shall find the earliest
native and truly literary awakening in England. Here we perceive
the endeavor to do something more than merely to aid the memory of
men in preserving necessary laws and records of important events.
The imagination had become active. The impulse was felt to give
expression to deep emotions, to sing the deeds and noble character
of some hero embodying the loftiest ideals of the time and the
race, to utter deep religious feeling. There was an effort to do
this in a form showing harmony in theme and presentation. Here we
find displayed a feeling for art, often crude, but still a true and
native impulse. This activity produced or gave definite form to the
earliest Anglo-Saxon poetry, a poetry often of a very high quality;
perhaps never of the highest, but always of intense interest. We
may claim even a greater distinction for the early fruit of
Anglo-Saxon inspiration. Mr. Stopford Brooke says:--"With the
exception of perhaps a few Welsh and Irish poems, it is the only
vernacular poetry in Europe, outside of the classic tongues, which
belongs to so early a time as the seventh and eighth
centuries."</p>
<p>The oldest of these poems belong in all save their final form to
the ancient days in Northern Germany. They bear evidence of
transmission, with varying details, from gleeman to gleeman, till
they were finally carried over to England and there edited, often
with discordant interpolations and modifications, by Christian
scribes. Tacitus tells us that at his time songs or poems were a
marked feature in the life of the Germans; but we cannot trace the
clue further. To these more ancient poems many others were added by
Christian Northumbrian poets, and we find that a large body of
poetry had grown up in the North before the movement was entirely
arrested by the destroying Northmen. Not one of these poems, unless
we except a few fragmentary verses, has come down to us in the
Northumbrian dialect. Fortunately they had been transcribed by the
less poetically gifted West Saxons into theirs, and it is in this
form that we possess them.</p>
<p>This poetry shows in subject and in treatment very considerable
range. We have a great poem, epic in character; poems partly
narrative and partly descriptive; poems that may be classed as
lyric or elegiac in character; a large body of verse containing a
paraphrase of portions of the Bible; a collection of 'Riddles';
poems on animals, with morals; and others difficult to
classify.</p>
<p>The regular verse-form was the alliterative, four-accent line,
broken by a strongly marked c&aelig;sura into two half-lines, which
were in early editions printed as short lines. The verse was
occasionally extended to six accents. In the normal verse there
were two alliterated words in the first half of the line, each of
which received a strong accent; in the second half there was one
accented word in alliteration with the alliterated words in the
first half, and one other accented word not in alliteration. A
great license was allowed as to the number of unaccented syllables,
and as to their position in regard to the accented ones; and this
lent great freedom and vigor to the verse. When well constructed
and well read, it must have been very effective. There were of
course many variations from the normal number, three, of
alliterated words, as it would be impossible to find so many for
every line.</p>
<p>Something of the quality of this verse-form may be felt in
translations which aim at the same effect. Notice the result in the
following from Professor Gummere's version of as election from
'Beowulf':--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"Then the warriors went, as the way was showed to them,</p>
<p class="i3">Under Heorot's roof; the hero stepped,</p>
<p class="i3">Hardy 'neath helm, till the hearth he neared."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In these verses it will be noted that the alliteration is
complete in the first and third, and that in the second it is
incomplete.</p>
<p>A marked feature of the Anglo-Saxon poetry is parallelism, or
the repetition of an idea by means of new phrases or epithets, most
frequently within the limits of a single sentence. This proceeds
from the desire to emphasize attributes ascribed to the deity, or
to some person or object prominent in the sentence. But while the
added epithets have often a cumulative force, and are picturesque,
yet it must be admitted that they sometimes do not justify their
introduction. This may be best illustrated by an example. The
following, in the translation of Earle, is C&aelig;dmon's first
hymn, composed between 658 and 680, and the earliest piece of
Anglo-Saxon poetry that we know to have had its origin in
England:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i1">"Now shall we glorify the guardian of heaven's
realm,</p>
<p class="i1">The Maker's might and the thought of his mind;</p>
<p class="i1">The work of the Glory-Father, how He of every
wonder,</p>
<p class="i3">He, the Lord eternal, laid the foundation.</p>
<p class="i3">He shaped erst for the sons of men</p>
<p class="i3">Heaven, their roof, Holy Creator;</p>
<p class="i3">The middle world, He, mankind's sovereign,</p>
<p class="i3">Eternal captain, afterwards created,</p>
<p class="i3">The land for men, Lord Almighty."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Many of the figurative expressions are exceedingly vigorous and
poetic; some to our taste not so much so. Note the epithets in "the
lank wolf," "the wan raven," "bird greedy for slaughter," "the
dewy-winged eagle," "dusky-coated," "crooked-beaked,"
"horny-beaked," "the maid, fair-cheeked," "curly-locked,"
"elf-bright." To the Anglo-Saxon poet, much that we call
metaphorical was scarcely more than literal statement. As the
object pictured itself to his responsive imagination, he expressed
it with what was to him a direct realism. His lines are filled with
a profusion of metaphors of every degree of effectiveness. To him
the sea was "the water-street," "the swan-path," "the strife of the
waves," "the whale-path"; the ship was "the foamy-necked floater,"
"the wave-farer," "the sea-wood," "the sea-horse"; the arrow was
"the battle adder"; the battle was "spear-play," "sword-play"; the
prince was "the ring-giver," "the gold-friend"; the throne was "the
gift-stool"; the body, "the bone-house"; the mind, "the
breast-hoard."</p>
<p>Indeed, as it has been pointed out by many writers, the metaphor
is almost the only figure of the Anglo-Saxon poetry. The more
developed simile belongs to a riper and more reflective culture,
and is exceedingly rare in this early native product. It has been
noted that 'Beowulf,' a poem of three thousand one hundred and
eighty-four lines, contains only four or five simple similes, and
only one that is fully carried out. "The ship glides away likest to
a bird," "The monster's eyes gleam like fire," are simple examples
cited by Ten Brink, who gives also the elaborate one, "The
sword-hilt melted, likened to ice, when the Father looseneth the
chain of frost, and unwindeth the wave-ropes." But even this simile
is almost obliterated by the crowding metaphors.</p>
<p>Intensity, an almost abrupt directness, a lack of explanatory
detail, are more general characteristics, though in greatly varying
degrees. As some critic has well said, the Anglo-Saxon poet seems
to presuppose a knowledge of his subject-matter by those he
addresses. Such a style is capable of great swiftness of movement,
and is well suited to rapid description and narrative; but at times
roughness or meagreness results.</p>
<p>The prevailing tone is one of sadness. In the lyric poetry, this
is so decided that all the Anglo-Saxon lyrics have been called
elegies. This note seems to be the echo of the struggle with an
inhospitable climate, dreary with rain, ice, hail, and snow; and of
the uncertainties of life, and the certainty of death. Suffering
was never far off, and everything was in the hands of Fate. This is
true at least of the earlier poetry, and the note is rarely absent
even in the Christian lyrics. A more cheerful strain is sometimes
heard, as in the 'Riddles,' but it is rather the exception; and any
alleged humor is scarcely more than a suspicion. Love and
sentiment, in the modern sense, are not made the subject of
Anglo-Saxon poetry, and this must mean that they did not enter into
the Anglo-Saxon life with the same intensity as into modern life.
The absence of this beautiful motive has, to some degree, its
compensation in the exceeding moral purity of the whole literature.
It is doubtful whether it has its equal in this respect.</p>
<p>Anglo-Saxon prose displays, as a general thing, a simple,
direct, and clear style. There is, of course, a considerable
difference between the prose of the earlier and that of the later
period, and individual writers show peculiarities. It displays
throughout a marked contrast with the poetic style, in its freedom
from parallelisms in thought and phrase, from inversions,
archaisms, and the almost excessive wealth of metaphor and epithet.
In its early stages, there is apparent perhaps a poverty of
resource, a lack of flexibility; but this charge cannot be
sustained against the best prose of the later period. In the
translations from the Latin it shows a certain stiffness, and
becomes sometimes involved, in the too conscientious effort of the
translator to follow the classic original.</p>
<p>No attempt will be made here to notice, or even to name, all the
large number of literary works of the Anglo-Saxons. It must be
sufficient to examine briefly a few of the most important and
characteristic productions of this really remarkable and prolific
movement.</p>
<p>The 'Song of Widsith, the Far Traveler,' is now generally
conceded to be, in part at least, the oldest existing Anglo-Saxon
poem. We do not know when it assumed its present form; but it is
certain that it was after the conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, since
it has interpolations from the Christian scribe. The poem seems to
give evidence of being a growth from an original song by a
wandering sc&ocirc;p, or poet, who claims to have visited the
Gothic king Eormanric, "the grim violator of treaties," who died in
375 or 376. But other kings are mentioned who lived in the first
half of the sixth century. It is probable, then, that it was begun
in the fourth century, and having been added to by successive
gleemen, as it was transmitted orally, was finally completed in the
earlier part of the sixth. It was then carried over to England, and
there first written down in Northumbria. It possesses great
interest because of its antiquity, and because of the light it
throws upon the life of the professional singer in those ancient
times among the Teutons. It has a long list of kings and places,
partly historical, partly mythical or not identified. The poem,
though narrative and descriptive, is also lyrical. We find here the
strain of elegiac sadness, of regretful retrospection, so generally
present in Anglo-Saxon poetry of lyric character, and usually much
more pronounced than in 'Widsith.'</p>
<p>'Beowulf' is, in many respects, the most important poetical
monument of the Anglo-Saxons. The poem is undoubtedly of heathen
origin, and the evidence that it was a gradual growth, the result
of grouping several distinct songs around one central figure, seems
unmistakable. We may trace it, in its earliest stages, to the
ancient home of the Angles in North Germany. It was transplanted to
England in the migration of the tribes, and was edited in the
present form by some unknown Northumbrian poet. When this occurred
we do not know certainly, but there seems good reason for assuming
the end of the seventh or the beginning of the eighth century as
the time.</p>
<p>The poem is epic in cast and epic in proportion. Although,
judged by the Homeric standard, it falls short in many respects of
the complete form, yet it may without violence be called an epic.
The central figure, Beowulf, a nobly conceived hero, possessing
immense strength, unflinching courage, a never-swerving sense of
honor, magnanimity, and generosity, the friend and champion of the
weak against evil however terrible, is the element of unity in the
whole poem. It is in itself a great honor to the race that they
were able to conceive as their ideal a hero so superior in all that
constitutes true nobility to the Greek ideal, Achilles. It is true
that the poem consists of two parts, connected by little more than
the fact that they have the same hero at different times of life;
that episodes are introduced that do not blend perfectly into the
unity of the poem; and that there is a lack of repose and sometimes
of lucidity. Yet there is a dignity and vigor, and a large
consistency in the treatment of the theme, that is epic. Ten Brink
says:--"The poet's intensity is not seldom imparted to the
listener.... The portrayals of battles, although much less
realistic than the Homeric descriptions, are yet at times superior
to them, in so far as the demoniac rage of war elicits from the
Germanic fancy a crowding affluence of vigorous scenes hastily
projected in glittering lights of grim half gloom." In addition to
its great poetic merit, 'Beowulf' is of the greatest importance to
us on account of the many fine pictures of ancient Teutonic life it
presents.</p>
<p>In the merest outline, the argument of 'Beowulf' is as
follows:--Hrothgar, King of the Gar-Danes, has built a splendid
hall, called Heorot. This is the scene of royal festivity until a
monster from the fen, Grendel, breaks into it by night and devours
thirty of the king's thanes. From that time the hall is desolate,
for no one can cope with Grendel, and Hrothgar is in despair.
Beowulf, the noble hero of the Geats, in Sweden, hears of the
terrible calamity, and with fourteen companions sails across the
sea to undertake the adventure. Hrothgar receives him joyfully, and
after a splendid banquet gives Heorot into his charge. During the
following night, Beowulf is attacked by Grendel; and after one of
his companions has been slain, he tears out the arm of the monster,
who escapes, mortally hurt, to his fen. On the morrow all is
rejoicing; but when night falls, the monster's mother attacks
Heorot, and kills Hrothgar's favorite thane. The next day, Beowulf
pursues her to her den under the waters of the fen, and after a
terrific combat slays her. The hero returns home to Sweden laden
with gifts. This ends the main thread of the first incident. In the
second incident, after an interval of fifty years, we find Beowulf
an old man. He has been for many years king of the Geats. A
fire-breathing dragon, the guardian of a great treasure, is
devastating the land. The heroic old king, accompanied by a party
of thanes, attacks the dragon. All the thanes save one are
cowardly; but the old hero, with the aid of the faithful one, slays
the dragon, not, however, till he is fatally injured. Then follow
his death and picturesque burial.</p>
<p>In this sketch, stirring episodes, graphic descriptions, and
fine effects are all sacrificed. The poem itself is a noble one and
the English people may well be proud of preserving in it the first
epic production of the Teutonic race.</p>
<p>The 'Fight at Finnsburg' is a fine fragment of epic cast. The
Finn saga is at least as old as the Beowulf poem, since the gleeman
at Hrothgar's banquet makes it his theme. From the fragment and the
gleeman's song we perceive that the situation here is much more
complex than is usual in Anglo-Saxon poems, and involves a tragic
conflict of passion. Hildeburh's brother is slain through the
treachery of her husband, Finn; her son, partaking of Finn's
faithlessness, falls at the hands of her brother's men; in a
subsequent counterplot, her husband is slain. Besides the
extraordinary vigor of the narrative, the theme has special
interest in that a woman is really the central figure, though not
treated as a heroine.</p>
<p>A favorite theme in the older lyric poems is the complaint of
some wandering sc&ocirc;p, driven from his home by the exigencies
of those perilous times. Either the singer has been bereft of his
patron by death, or he has been supplanted in his favor by some
successful rival; and he passes in sorrowful review his former
happiness, and contrasts it with his present misery. The oldest of
these lyrics are of pagan origin, though usually with Christian
additions.</p>
<p>In the 'Wanderer,' an unknown poet pictures the exile who has
fled across the sea from his home. He is utterly lonely. He must
lock his sorrow in his heart. In his dream he embraces and kisses
his lord, and lays his head upon his knee, as of old. He awakes,
and sees nothing but the gray sea, the snow and hail, and the birds
dipping their wings in the waves. And so he reflects: the world is
full of care; we are all in the hands of Fate. Then comes the
Christian sentiment: happy is he who seeks comfort with his Father
in heaven, with whom alone all things are enduring.</p>
<p>Another fine poem of this class, somewhat similar to the
'Wanderer,' is the 'Seafarer.' It is, however, distinct in detail
and treatment, and has its own peculiar beauty. In the 'Fortunes of
Men,' the poet treats the uncertainty of all things earthly, from
the point of view of the parent forecasting the ill and the good
the future may bring to his sons. 'Deor's Lament' possesses a
genuine lyrical quality of high order. The singer has been
displaced by a rival, and finds consolation in his grief from
reciting the woes that others have endured, and reflects in each
instance, "That was got over, and so this may be." Other poems on
other subjects might be noticed here; as 'The Husband's Message,'
where the love of husband for wife is the theme, and 'The Ruin,'
which contains reflections suggested by a ruined city.</p>
<p>It is a remarkable fact that only two of these poets are known
to us by name, C&aelig;dmon and Cynewulf. We find the story of the
inspiration, work, and death of C&aelig;dmon, the earlier of these,
told in the pages of Bede. The date of his birth is not given, but
his death fell in 680. He was a Northumbrian, and was connected in
a lay capacity with the great monastery of Whitby. He was
uneducated, and not endowed in his earlier life with the gift of
song. One night, after he had fled in mortification from a feast
where all were required to improvise and sing, he received, as he
slept, the divine inspiration. The next day he made known his new
gift to the authorities of the monastery. After he had triumphantly
made good his claims, he was admitted to holy orders, and began his
work of paraphrasing into noble verse portions of the Scriptures
that were read to him. Of the body of poetry that comes down to us
under his name, we cannot be sure that any is his, unless we except
the short passage given here. It is certainly the work of different
poets, and varies in merit. The evidence seems conclusive that he
was a poet of high order, that his influence was very great, and
that many others wrote in his manner. The actors and the scenery of
the C&aelig;dmonian poetry are entirely Anglo-Saxon, only the names
and the outline of the narrative being biblical; and the spirit of
battle that breathes in some passages is the same that we find in
the heathen epic.</p>
<p>Cynewulf was most probably a Northumbrian, though this is
sometimes questioned. The dates of his birth and death are unknown.
It seems established, however, that his work belongs to the eighth
century. A great deal of controversy has arisen over a number of
poems that have been ascribed to him and denied to him with equal
persistency. But we stand upon sure ground in regard to four poems,
the 'Christ,' the 'Fates of the Apostles,' 'Juliana,' and 'Elene';
for he has signed them in runes. If the runic enigma in the first
of the 'Riddles' has been correctly interpreted, then they, or
portions of them, are his also. But about this there is much doubt.
The 'Andreas' and the 'Dream of the Rood' may be mentioned as being
of exceptional interest among the poems that are almost certainly
his. In the latter, he tells, in a personal strain, the story of
the appearance to him of the holy cross, and of his conversion and
dedication of himself to the service of Christ. The 'Elene,'
generally considered the finest of his poems, is the story of the
miraculous finding of the holy cross by St. Helena, the mother of
the Emperor Constantine. The poet has lent great charm to the
tradition in his treatment. The poem sounds a triumphant note
throughout, till we reach the epilogue, where the poet speaks in
his own person and in a sadder tone.</p>
<p>The quality of Cynewulf's poetry is unequal; but when he is at
his best, he is a great poet and a great artist. His personality
appears in direct subjective utterance more plainly than does that
of any other Anglo-Saxon poet.</p>
<p>While we must pass over many fine Anglo-Saxon poems without
mention, there are two that must receive some notice. 'Judith' is
an epic based upon the book of Judith in the 'Apocrypha.' Only
about one-fourth of it has survived. The author is still unknown,
in spite of many intelligent efforts to determine to whom the honor
belongs. The dates assigned to it vary from the seventh to the
tenth century; here, too, uncertainty prevails: but we are at least
sure that it is one of the best of the Anglo-Saxon poems. It has
been said that this work shows a more definite plan and more
conscious art than any other Anglo-Saxon poem. Brooke finds it
sometimes conventional in the form of expression, and denies it the
highest rank for that reason. But he does not seem to sustain the
charge. The two principal characters, the dauntless Judith and the
brutal Holofernes, stand out with remarkable distinctness, and a
fine dramatic quality has been noted by several critics. The
epithets and metaphors, the description of the drunken debauch, and
the swift, powerful narrative of the battle and the rout of the
Assyrians, are in the best Anglo-Saxon epic strain. The poem is
distinctly Christian; for the Hebrew heroine, with a na&iuml;ve
anachronism, prays thus: "God of Creation, Spirit of Consolation,
Son of the Almighty, I pray for Thy mercy to me, greatly in need of
it. Glory of the Trinity."</p>
<p>'The Battle of Maldon' is a ballad, containing an account of a
fight between the Northmen and the East Saxons under the Aldorman,
Byrhtnoth. The incident is mentioned in one MS. of the Chronicle
under the date of 991; in another, under the date of 993. The poem
is exceedingly graphic. The poet seems filled with intense feeling,
and may have been a spectator, or may indeed have taken part in the
struggle. He tells how the brave old Aldorman disdains to use the
advantage of his position, which bade fair to give him victory.
Like a boy, he cannot take a dare, but fatuously allows the enemy
to begin the battle upon an equal footing with his own men. He pays
for his noble folly with his life and the defeat of his army. The
devotion of the Aldorman's hearth-companions, who refuse to survive
their lord, and with brave words meet their death, is finely
described. But not all are true; some, who have been especially
favored, ignobly flee. These are treated with the racial contempt
for cowards. The poem has survived in fragmentary form, and the
name of the poet is not known.</p>
<p>As distinguished from all poetical remains of such literature,
the surviving prose of the Anglo-Saxons, though extensive, and of
the greatest interest and value, is less varied in subject and
manner than their poetry. It admits of brief treatment. The
earliest known specimens of Anglo-Saxon prose writing have been
already mentioned. These do not constitute the beginning of a
literature, yet, with the rest of the extensive collection of
Anglo-Saxon laws that has survived, they are of the greatest
importance to students. Earle quotes Dr. Reinhold Schmid as saying,
"No other Germanic nation has bequeathed to us out of its earliest
experience so rich a treasure of original legal documents as the
Anglo-Saxon nation has,"--only another instance of the precocity of
our ancestors.</p>
<p>To the West Saxons belongs nearly the whole of Anglo-Saxon
prose. Whatever may have existed in Northumbria perished in the
inroads of the Northmen, except such parts as may have been
incorporated in West Saxon writings. It will be remembered,
however, that the great Northumbrian prose writers had held to the
Latin as their medium. The West Saxon prose literature may be said
to begin in Alfred's reign.</p>
<p>The most important production that we have to consider is the
famous Anglo-Saxon 'Chronicle.' It covers with more or less
completeness the period from 449 to 1154. This was supplemented by
fanciful genealogies leading back to Woden, or even to Adam. It is
not known when the practice of jotting down in the native speech
notices of contemporary events began, but probably in very early
times. It is believed, however, that no intelligent effort to
collect and present them with order and system was made until the
middle of the ninth century. In the oldest of the seven MSS. in
which it has come down to us, we have the 'Chronicle' to 891, as it
was written down in Alfred's time and probably under his
supervision.</p>
<p>The meagreness of the earliest entries and the crudeness of the
language, together with occasional picturesque force, indicate that
many of them were drawn from current song or tradition. The style
and fullness of the entries differ greatly throughout, as might be
expected, since the 'Chronicle' is the work of so many hands. From
mere bare notices they vary to strong, full narrative and
description. Indeed, the 'Chronicle' contains some of the most
effective prose produced by the Anglo-Saxons; and in one instance,
under the date 937, the annalist describes the battle of Brunanburh
in a poem of considerable merit. But we know the name of no single
contributor.</p>
<p>This 'Chronicle' is the oldest and most important work of the
kind produced outside of the classical languages in Europe. It is
meagre in places, and its entire trustworthiness has been
questioned. But it and Bede's 'Ecclesiastical History,'
supplemented by other Anglo-Saxon writings, constitute the basis of
early English history; and this fact alone entitles it to the
highest rank in importance among ancient documents.</p>
<p>A large body of Anglo-Saxon prose, nearly all of it translation
or adaptation of Latin works, has come down to us under the name of
King Alfred. A peculiar interest attaches to these works. They
belong to a period when the history of England depended more than
at any other time upon the ability and devotion of one man; and
that man, the most heroic and the greatest of English kings, was
himself the author of them.</p>
<p>When Alfred became king, in 871, his throne seemed tottering to
its fall. Practically all the rest of England was at the feet of
the ruthless Northmen, and soon Alfred himself was little better
than a fugitive. But by his military skill, which was successful if
not brilliant, and by his never-wavering devotion and English
persistency, he at last freed the southern part of the island from
his merciless and treacherous enemies, and laid the firm foundation
of West Saxon supremacy. If Alfred had failed in any respect to be
the great king that he was, English history would have been changed
for all time.</p>
<p>Although Alfred had saved his kingdom, yet it was a kingdom
almost in ruins. The hopeful advance of culture had been entirely
arrested. The great centres of learning had been utterly destroyed
in the north, and little remained intact in the south. And even
worse than this was the demoralization of all classes, and an
indisposition to renewed effort. There was, moreover, a great
scarcity of books.</p>
<p>Alfred showed himself as great in peace as in war, and at once
set to work to meet all those difficulties. To supply the books
that were so urgently needed, he found time in the midst of his
perplexing cares to translate from the Latin into the native speech
such works as he thought would supply the most pressing want. This
was the more necessary from the prevailing ignorance of Latin. It
is likely that portions of the works that go under his name were
produced under his supervision by carefully selected co-workers.
But it is certain that in a large part of them we may see the work
of the great Alfred's own hand.</p>
<p>He has used his own judgment in these translations, omitting
whatever he did not think would be immediately helpful to his
people, and making such additions as he thought might be of
advantage. Just these additions have the greatest interest for us.
He translated, for instance, Orosius's 'History'; a work in itself
of inferior worth, but as an attempt at a universal history from
the Christian point of view, he thought it best suited to the needs
of his people. The Anglo-Saxon version contains most interesting
additions of original matter by Alfred. They consist of accounts of
the voyages of Ohtere, a Norwegian, who was the first, so far as we
know, to sail around the North Cape and into the White Sea, and of
Wulfstan, who explored parts of the coast of the Baltic. These
narratives give us our first definite information about the lands
and people of these regions, and appear to have been taken down by
the king directly as related by the explorers. Alfred added to this
'History' also a description of Central Europe, which Morley calls
"the only authentic record of the Germanic nations written by a
contemporary so early as the ninth century."</p>
<p>In Gregory's 'Pastoral Care' we have Alfred's closest
translation. It is a presentation of "the ideal Christian pastor"
(Ten Brink), and was intended for the benefit of the lax
Anglo-Saxon priests. Perhaps the work that appealed most strongly
to Alfred himself was Boethius's 'Consolations of Philosophy'; and
in his full translation and adaptation of this book we see the hand
and the heart of the good king. We shall mention one other work of
Alfred's, his translation of the already frequently mentioned
'Historia Ecclesiastica Anglorum' of the Venerable Bede. This great
work Alfred, with good reason, considered to be of the greatest
possible value to his people; and the king has given it additional
value for us.</p>
<p>Alfred was not a great scholar. The wonder is that, in the
troublous times of his youth, he had learned even the rudiments.
The language in his translations, however, though not infrequently
affected for the worse by the Latin idiom of the original, is in
the main free from ornament of any kind, simple and direct, and
reflects in its sincerity the noble character of the great
king.</p>
<p>The period between the death of Alfred (901) and the end of the
tenth century was deficient in works of literary value, except an
entry here and there in the 'Chronicle.' "Alfric's is the last
great name in the story of our literature before the Conquest,"
says Henry Morley. He began writing about the end of the tenth
century, and we do not know when his work and his life ended. This
gentle priest, as he appears to us through his writings, following
Alfred's example, wrote not from personal ambition, but for the
betterment of his fellow-men. His style is eminently lucid, fluent,
forcible, and of graceful finish. Earle observes of it:--"The
English of these Homilies is splendid; indeed, we may confidently
say that here English appears fully qualified to be the medium of
the highest learning." This is high praise, and should be well
considered by those disposed to consider the Anglo-Saxon as a rude
tongue, incapable of great development in itself, and only enabled
by the Norman infusion to give expression to a deep and broad
culture.</p>
<p>Alfric's works in Anglo-Saxon--for he wrote also in Latin--were
very numerous, embracing two series of homilies, theological
writings of many kinds, translations of portions of the Bible, an
English (Anglo-Saxon) grammar, adapted from a Latin work, a Latin
dictionary, and many other things of great use in their day and of
great interest in ours.</p>
<p>The names of other writers and of other single works might well
be added here. But enough has been said, perhaps, to show that a
great and hopeful development of prose took place among the West
Saxons. It must be admitted that the last years of the Anglo-Saxon
nationality before the coming of the Normans show a decline in
literary productiveness of a high order. The causes of this are to
be found chiefly in the political and ecclesiastical history of the
time. Wars with the Northmen, internal dissensions, religious
controversies, the greater cultivation of Latin by the priesthood,
all contributed to it. But hopeful signs of a new revival were not
wanting. The language had steadily developed with the enlightenment
of the people, and was fast becoming fit to meet any demands that
might be made upon it, when the great catastrophe of the Norman
Conquest came, and with it practically the end of the historical
and distinctive Anglo-Saxon literature.</p>

<blockquote>That pass'd over,--and this may, too!</blockquote>
We have also heard of Ermanric's<br>
wolfish mind; wide was his sway<br>
o'er the Gothic race,--a ruler grim.<br>
Sat many a man in misery bound,<br>
waited but woe, and wish'd amain<br>
that ruin might fall on the royal house.
<blockquote>That pass'd over,--and this may, too!</blockquote>
Sitteth one sighing, sunder'd from happiness;<br>
all's dark within him; he deems forsooth<br>
that his share of evils shall endless be.<br>
Let such bethink him that thro' this world<br>
mighty God sends many changes:<br>
to earls a plenty honor he shows,<br>
ease and bliss; to others, sorrow.<br>
<br>
Now I will say of myself, and how<br>
I was singer once to the sons of Heoden,<br>
dear to my master, and Deor was my name.<br>
Long were the winters my lord was kind,<br>
happy my lot,--till Heorrenda now<br>
by grace of singing has gained the land<br>
which the "haven of heroes" erewhile gave me.
<blockquote>That pass'd over,--and this may, too!</blockquote>

WANDERER'</b></p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Oft-times the Wanderer waiteth God's mercy,</p>
<p class="i1">Sad and disconsolate though he may be,</p>
<p>Far o'er the watery track must he travel,</p>
<p class="i1">Long must he row o'er the rime-crusted sea--</p>
<p>Plod his lone exile-path--Fate is severe.</p>
<p class="i1">Mindful of slaughter, his kinsman friends' death,</p>
<p class="i1">Mindful of hardships, the wanderer saith:--</p>
<p>Oft must I lonely, when dawn doth appear,</p>
<p class="i1">Wail o'er my sorrow--since living is none</p>
<p class="i1">Whom I may whisper my heart's undertone.</p>
<p>Know I full well that in man it is noble</p>
<p class="i1">Fast in his bosom his sorrow to bind.</p>
<p>Weary at heart, yet his Fate is unyielding--</p>
<p class="i1">Help cometh not to his suffering mind.</p>
<p>Therefore do those who are thirsting for glory</p>
<p class="i1">Bind in their bosom each pain's biting smart.</p>
<p>Thus must I often, afar from my kinsmen,</p>
<p class="i1">Fasten in fetters my home-banished heart.</p>
<p>Now since the day when my dear prince departed</p>
<p class="i1">Wrapped in the gloom of his dark earthen grave,</p>
<p>I, a poor exile, have wandered in winter</p>
<p class="i1">Over the flood of the foam-frozen wave,</p>
<p>Seeking, sad-hearted, some giver of treasure,</p>
<p class="i1">Some one to cherish me friendless--some chief</p>
<p>Able to guide me with wisdom of counsel,</p>
<p class="i1">Willing to greet me and comfort my grief.</p>
<p>He who hath tried it, and he alone, knoweth</p>
<p class="i1">How harsh a comrade is comfortless Care</p>
<p>Unto the man who hath no dear protector,</p>
<p class="i1">Gold wrought with fingers nor treasure so fair.</p>
<p>Chill is his heart as he roameth in exile--</p>
<p class="i1">Thinketh of banquets his boyhood saw spread;</p>
<p>Friends and companions partook of his pleasures--</p>
<p>Knoweth he well that all friendless and lordless</p>
<p class="i1">Sorrow awaits him a long bitter while;--</p>
<p>Yet, when the spirits of Sorrow and Slumber</p>
<p class="i1">Fasten with fetters the orphaned exile,</p>
<p>Seemeth him then that he seeth in spirit,</p>
<p class="i1">Meeteth and greeteth his master once more,</p>
<p>Layeth his head on his lord's loving bosom,</p>
<p class="i1">Just as he did in the dear days of yore.</p>
<p>But he awaketh, forsaken and friendless,</p>
<p class="i1">Seeth before him the black billows rise,</p>
<p>Seabirds are bathing and spreading their feathers,</p>
<p class="i1">Hailsnow and hoar-frost are hiding the skies.</p>
<p>Then in his heart the more heavily wounded,</p>
<p class="i1">Longeth full sore for his loved one, his own,</p>
<p>Sad is the mind that remembereth kinsmen,</p>
<p class="i1">Greeting with gladness the days that are gone.</p>
<p>Seemeth him then on the waves of the ocean</p>
<p class="i1">Comrades are swimming,--well-nigh within reach,--</p>
<p>Yet from the spiritless lips of the swimmers</p>
<p class="i1">Cometh familiar no welcoming speech.</p>
<p>So is his sorrow renewed and made sharper</p>
<p class="i1">When the sad exile so often must send</p>
<p>Thoughts of his suffering spirit to wander</p>
<p class="i1">Wide o'er the waves where the rough billows
blend.</p>
<p>So, lest the thought of my mind should be clouded,</p>
<p class="i1">Close must I prison my sadness of heart,</p>
<p>When I remember my bold comrade-kinsmen,</p>
<p class="i1">How from the mede-hall I saw them depart.</p>
<p>Thus is the earth with its splendor departing--</p>
<p class="i1">Day after day it is passing away,</p>
<p>Nor may a mortal have much of true wisdom</p>
<p class="i1">Till his world-life numbers many a day.</p>
<p>He who is wise, then, must learn to be patient--</p>
<p class="i1">Not too hot-hearted, too hasty of speech,</p>
<p>Neither too weak nor too bold in the battle,</p>
<p class="i1">Fearful, nor joyous, nor greedy to reach,</p>
<p>Neither too ready to boast till he knoweth--</p>
<p class="i1">Man must abide, when he vaunted his pride,</p>
<p>Till strong of mind he hath surely determined</p>
<p class="i1">Whether his purpose can be turned aside.</p>
<p>Surely the wise man may see like the desert</p>
<p class="i1">How the whole wealth of the world lieth waste,</p>
<p>How through the earth the lone walls are still standing,</p>
<p class="i1">Blown by the wind and despoiled and defaced.</p>
<p>Covered with frost, the proud dwellings are ruined,</p>
<p class="i1">Crumbled the wine-halls--the king lieth low,</p>
<p>Robbed of his pride--and his troop have all fallen</p>
<p class="i1">Proud by the wall--some, the spoil of the foe,</p>
<p>War took away--and some the fierce sea-fowl</p>
<p class="i1">Over the ocean--and some the wolf gray</p>
<p>Tore after death--and yet others the hero</p>
<p>Sad-faced has laid in earth-caverns away.</p>
<p>Thus at his will the eternal Creator</p>
<p class="i1">Famished the fields of the earth's ample fold--</p>
<p>Until her dwellers abandoned their feast-boards.</p>
<p class="i1">Void stood the work of the giants of old.</p>
<p>One who was viewing full wisely this wall-place,</p>
<p class="i1">Pondering deeply his dark, dreary life.</p>
<p>Spake then as follows, his past thus reviewing,</p>
<p class="i1">Years full of slaughter and struggle and
strife:--</p>
<p>"Wither, alas, have my horses been carried?</p>
<p class="i1">Whither, alas, are my kinspeople gone?</p>
<p>Where is my giver of treasure and feasting?</p>
<p class="i1">Where are the joys of the hall I have known?</p>
<p>Ah, the bright cup--and the corseleted warrior--</p>
<p class="i1">Ah, the bright joy of a king's happy lot!</p>
<p>How the glad time has forever departed,</p>
<p class="i1">Swallowed in darkness, as though it were not!</p>
<p>Standeth, instead of the troop of young warriors,</p>
<p class="i1">Stained with the bodies of dragons, a wall--</p>
<p>The men were cut down in their pride by the spearpoints--</p>
<p class="i1">Blood-greedy weapons--but noble their fall.</p>
<p>Earth is enwrapped in the lowering tempest,</p>
<p class="i1">Fierce on the stone-cliff the storm rushes forth,</p>
<p>Cold winter-terror, the night shade is dark'ning,</p>
<p class="i1">Hail-storms are laden with death from the north.</p>
<p>All full of hardships is earthly existence--</p>
<p class="i1">Here the decrees of the Fates have their sway--</p>
<p>Fleeting is treasure and fleeting is friendship--</p>
<p class="i1">Here man is transient, here friends pass away.</p>
<p>Earth's widely stretching, extensive domain,</p>
<p class="i1">Desolate all--empty, idle, and vain."</p>

<blockquote>Sooth the song that I of myself can sing,<br>
Telling of my travels; how in troublous days,<br>
Hours of hardship oft I've borne!<br>
With a bitter breast-care I have been abiding;<br>
Many seats of sorrow in my ship have known!<br>
Frightful was the whirl of waves when it was my part<br>
Narrow watch at night to keep on my Vessel's prow<br>
When it rushed the rocks along. By the rigid cold<br>
Fast my feet were pinched, fettered by the frost,<br>
By the chains of cold. Care was sighing then<br>
Hot my heart around; hunger rent to shreds<br>
Courage in me, me sea-wearied! This the man knows not,<br>
He to whom it happens, happiest on earth,<br>
How I, carked with care, in the ice-cold sea,<br>
Overwent the winter on my wander-ways,<br>
All forlorn of happiness, all bereft of loving kinsmen,<br>
Hung about with icicles; flew the hail in showers.<br>
Nothing heard I there save the howling of the sea,<br>
And the ice-chilled billow, 'whiles the crying of the swan.<br>
All the glee I got me was the gannet's scream,<br>
And the swoughing of the seal, 'stead of mirth of men;<br>
'Stead of the mead-drinking, moaning of the sea-mew.<br>
There the storms smote on the crags, there the swallow of the
sea<br>
Answered to them, icy-plumed; and that answer oft the earn--<br>
Wet his wings were--barked aloud.<br>
<blockquote>None of all my kinsmen</blockquote>
Could this sorrow-laden soul stir to any joy.<br>
Little then does he believe who life's pleasure owns,<br>
While he tarries in the towns, and but trifling ills,<br>
Proud and insolent with wine--how out-wearied I<br>
Often must outstay on the ocean path!<br>
Sombre grew the shade of night, and it snowed from northward,<br>
Frost the field enchained, fell the hail on earth,<br>
Coldest of all grains.<br>
<blockquote>Wherefore now then crash together</blockquote>
Thoughts my soul within that I should myself adventure<br>
The high streamings of the sea, and the sport of the salt
waves!<br>
For a passion of the mind every moment pricks me on<br>
All my life to set a faring; so that far from hence,<br>
I may seek the shore of the strange outlanders.<br>
Yes, so haughty of his heart is no hero on the earth,<br>
Nor so good in all his giving, nor so generous in youth,<br>
Nor so daring in his deed, nor so dear unto his lord,<br>
That he has not always yearning unto his sea-faring,<br>
To whatever work his Lord may have will to make for him.<br>
For the harp he has no heart, nor for having of the rings,<br>
Nor in woman is his weal, in the world he's no delight,<br>
Nor in anything whatever save the tossing o'er the waves!<br>
Oh, forever he has longing who is urged towards the sea.<br>
Trees rebloom with blossoms, burghs are fair again,<br>
Winsome are the wide plains, and the world is gay--<br>
All doth only challenge the impassioned heart<br>
Of his courage to the voyage, whosoever thus bethinks him,<br>
O'er the ocean billows, far away to go.<br>
Every cuckoo calls a warning, with his chant of sorrow!<br>
Sings the summer's watchman, sorrow is he boding,<br>
Bitter in the bosom's hoard. This the brave man wots not of,<br>
Not the warrior rich in welfare--what the wanderer endures,<br>
Who his paths of banishment, widest places on the sea.<br>
For behold, my thought hovers now above my heart;<br>
O'er the surging flood of sea now my spirit flies,<br>
O'er the homeland of the whale--hovers then afar<br>
O'er the foldings of the earth! Now again it flies to me<br>
Full of yearning, greedy! Yells that lonely flier;<br>
Whets upon the Whale-way irresistibly my heart,<br>
O'er the storming of the seas!</blockquote>

<blockquote>Full often it falls out, by fortune from God,<br>
That a man and a maiden may marry in this world,<br>
Find cheer in the child whom they cherish and care for,<br>
Tenderly tend it, until the time comes,<br>
Beyond the first years, when the young limbs increasing<br>
Grown firm with life's fullness, are formed for their work.<br>
Fond father and mother so guide it and feed it,<br>
Give gifts to it, clothe it: God only can know<br>
What lot to its latter days life has to bring.<br>
To some that make music in life's morning hour<br>
Pining days are appointed of plaint at the close.<br>
One the wild wolf shall eat, hoary haunter of wastes:<br>
His mother shall mourn the small strength of a man.<br>
One shall sharp hunger slay; one shall the storm beat down;<br>
One be destroyed by darts, one die in war.<br>
One shall live losing the light of his eyes,<br>
Feel blindly with fingers; and one, lame of foot,<br>
With sinew-wound wearily wasteth away,<br>
Musing and mourning, with death in his mind.<br>
One, failing feathers, shall fall from the height<br>
Of the tall forest tree; yet he trips as though flying,<br>
Plays proudly in air till he reaches the point<br>
Where the woodgrowth is weak; life then whirls in his brain,<br>
Bereft of his reason he sinks to the root,<br>
Falls flat on the ground, his life fleeting away.<br>
Afoot on the far-ways, his food in his hand,<br>
One shall go grieving, and great be his need,<br>
Press dew on the paths of the perilous lands<br>
Where the stranger may strike, where live none to sustain.<br>
All shun the desolate for being sad.<br>
One the great gallows shall have in its grasp,<br>
Stained in dark agony, till the soul's stay,<br>
The bone-house, is bloodily all broken up;<br>
When the harsh raven hacks eyes from the head,<br>
The sallow-coated, slits the soulless man.<br>
Nor can he shield from shame, scare with his hands,<br>
Off from their eager feast prowlers of air.<br>
Lost is his life to him, left is no breath,<br>
Bleached on the gallows-beam bides he his doom;<br>
Cold death-mists close round him called the Accursed.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 45%;">
<br>
One shall die by the dagger, in wrath, drenched with ale,<br>
Wild through wine, on the mead bench, too swift with his words;<br>
Through the hand that brings beer, through the gay boon
companion,<br>
His mouth has no measure, his mood no restraint;<br>
Too lightly his life shall the wretched one lose,<br>
Undergo the great ill, be left empty of joy.<br>
When they speak of him slain by the sweetness of mead,<br>
His comrades shall call him one killed by himself.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 45%;">

Some have good hap, and some hard days of toil;<br>
Some glad glow of youth, and some glory in war,<br>
Strength in the strife; some sling the stone, some shoot.<br>

<br>
One shall handle the harp, at the feet of his hero<br>
Sit and win wealth from the will of his Lord;<br>

Bold mail&egrave;d-warriors. There were lofty beakers<br>
Oft borne along the benches, also were cups and flagons<br>
Full to the hall-sitters borne. The fated partook of them,<br>

That children of men from afar might hear<br>
How the strong-minded both stormed and yelled,<br>
Moody and mead-drunken, often admonished<br>
The sitters-on-benches to bear themselves well.<br>
Thus did the hateful one during all day<br>
His liege-men loyal keep plying with wine,<br>
Stout-hearted giver of treasure, until they lay in a

<p>[Holofernes has been slain by Judith. The Hebrews, encouraged by

<blockquote>Then the band of the brave was quickly prepared,<br>
Of the bold for battle; stepped out the valiant<br>
Men and comrades, bore their banners,<br>
Went forth to fight straight on their way<br>
The heroes 'neath helmets from the holy city<br>
At the dawn itself; shields made a din,<br>
Loudly resounded. Thereat laughed the lank<br>
Wolf in the wood, and the raven wan,<br>
Fowl greedy for slaughter: both of them knew<br>
That for them the warriors thought to provide<br>
Their fill on the fated; and flew on their track<br>
The dewy-winged eagle eager for prey,<br>
The dusky-coated sang his war-song,<br>
The crooked-beaked. Stepped forth the warriors,<br>
The heroes for battle with boards protected,<br>
With hollow shields, who awhile before<br>
The foreign-folk's reproach endured,<br>
The heathens' scorn; fiercely was that<br>
At the ash-spear's play to them all repaid,<br>
All the Assyrians, after the Hebrews<br>
Under their banners had boldly advanced<br>
To the army-camps. They bravely then<br>
Forthright let fly showers of arrows,<br>
Of battle-adders, out from the horn-bows,<br>
Of strongly-made shafts; stormed they aloud,<br>
The cruel warriors, sent forth their spears<br>
Among the brave; the heroes were angry,<br>
The dwellers-in-land, with the loathed race;<br>
The stern-minded stepped, the stout-in-heart,<br>
Rudely awakened their ancient foes<br>
Weary from mead; with hands drew forth<br>
The men from the sheaths the brightly-marked swords<br>
Most choice in their edges, eagerly struck<br>
Of the host of Assyrians the battle-warriors,<br>
The hostile-minded; not one they spared<br>
Of the army-folk, nor low nor high<br>
Of living men, whom they might subdue.</blockquote>

<br>
<p>He [C&aelig;dmon] had remained in the secular life until the
time when he was of advanced age, and he had never learned any
song. For that reason oftentimes, when it was decided at a feasting
that all should sing in turn to the accompaniment of the harp for
the sake of entertainment, he would arise for shame from the
banquet when he saw the harp approaching him, and would go home to
his house. When he on a certain occasion had done this, and had
left the house of feasting, and had gone to the stable of the
cattle, which had been intrusted to his care for that night; and
when he there, after a reasonable time, had arranged his limbs for
rest, he fell asleep. And a man stood by him in a dream, and hailed
him, and greeted him, and called him by name, and said:
"C&aelig;dmon, sing something for me." Then he answered and said:
"I cannot sing; I went out from the feast and came hither because I
could not sing." Again said the one who was speaking with him:
"Nevertheless, thou canst sing for me." Said C&aelig;dmon, "What
shall I sing?" Said he, "Sing to me of creation."</p>
<p>When C&aelig;dmon received this answer, then began he soon to
sing in glorification of God the Creator, verses and words that he
had never before heard.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Then he arose from sleep and he had fast in his memory all those
things he had sung in his sleep; and to these words he soon added
many other words of song of the same measure, worthy for God.</p>
<p>Then came he in the morning to the town-reeve, who was his
aldorman, and told him of the gift he had received. And the reeve
soon led him to the abbess, and made that known to her and told
her. Then bade she assemble all the very learned men, and the
learners, and bade him tell the dream in their presence, and sing
the song, so that by the judgment of them all it might be
determined what it was, and whence it had come. Then it was seen by
them all, just as it was, that the heavenly gift had been given him
by the Lord himself.</p>

<h2><a name="FROM_THE_'CHRONICLE'"></a>FROM THE 'CHRONICLE'</h2>
<br>
<p>Selection from the entry for the year 897</p>
<p>Then Alfred, the King, ordered long ships built to oppose the
war-ships of the enemy. They were very nearly twice as long as the
others; some had sixty oars, some more. They were both swifter and
steadier, and also higher than the others; they were shaped neither
on the Frisian model nor on the Danish, but as it seemed to King
Alfred that they would be most useful.</p>
<p>Then, at a certain time in that year, came six hostile ships to
Wight, and did much damage, both in Devon and elsewhere on the
seaboard. Then the King ordered that nine of the new ships should
proceed thither. And his ships blockaded the mouth of the passage
on the outer-sea against the enemy. Then the Danes came out with
three ships against the King's ships; but three of the Danish ships
lay above the mouth, high and dry aground; and the men were gone
off upon the shore. Then the King's men took two of the three ships
outside, at the mouth, and slew the crews; but one ship escaped. On
this one all the men were slain except five; these escaped because
the King's ship got aground. They were aground, moreover, very
inconveniently, since three were situated upon the same side of the
channel with the three stranded Danish ships, and all the others
were upon the other side, so that there could be no communication
between the two divisions. But when the water had ebbed many
furlongs from the ships, then went the Danes from their three ships
to the King's three ships that had been left dry upon the same side
by the ebbing of the tide, and they fought together there. Then
were slain Lucumon, the King's Reeve, Wulfheard the Frisian, and
&AElig;bbe the Frisian, and &AElig;thelhere the Frisian, and
&AElig;thelferth the King's companion, and of all the men Frisians
and English, sixty-two; and of the Danes, one hundred and
twenty.</p>
<p>But the flood came to the Danish ships before the Christians
could shove theirs out, and for that reason the Danes rowed off.
They were, nevertheless, so grievously wounded that they could not
row around the land of the South Saxons, and the sea cast up there
two of the ships upon the shore. And the men from them were led to
Winchester to the King, and he commanded them to be hanged there.
But the men who were in the remaining ship came to East Anglia,
sorely wounded.</p>

<h2><a name="GABRIELE_D'ANNUNZIO"></a>GABRIELE D'ANNUNZIO</h2>
<h3>(1864-)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>n Italian poet and novelist of early promise, who has become a
somewhat unique figure in contemporary literature, Gabriele
d'Annunzio is a native of the Abruzzi, born in the little village
of Pescara, on the Adriatic coast. Its picturesque scenery has
formed the background for more than one of his stories. At the age
of fifteen, while still a student at Prato, he published his first
volume of poems, 'Intermezzo di Rime' (Interludes of Verse):
"grand, plastic verse, of an impeccable prosody," as he maintained
in their defense, but so daringly erotic that their appearance
created no small scandal. Other poems followed at intervals,
notably 'Il Canto Nuovo' (The New Song: Rome, 1882), 'Isotteo e la
Chimera' (Isotteo and the Chimera: Rome, 1890), 'Poema Paradisiaco'
and 'Odi Navali' (Marine Odes: Milan, 1893), which leave no doubt
of his high rank as poet. The novel, however, is his chosen vehicle
of expression, and the one which gives fullest scope to his rich
and versatile genius. His first long story, 'Il Piacere'
(Pleasure), appeared in 1889. As the title implies, it was pervaded
with a frank, almost complacent sensuality, which its author has
since been inclined to deprecate. Nevertheless, the book received
merited praise for its subtle portrayal of character and incident,
and its exuberance of phraseology; and more than all, for the
promise which it suggested. With the publication of 'L'Innocente,'
the author for the first time showed a real seriousness of purpose.
His views of life had meanwhile essentially altered:--"As was
just," he confessed, "I began to pay for my errors, my disorders,
my excesses: I began to suffer with the same intensity with which I
had formerly enjoyed myself; sorrow had made of me a new man."
Accordingly his later books, while still emphatically realistic,
are chastened by an underlying tone of pessimism. Passion is no
longer the keynote of life, but rather, as exemplified in 'Il
Trionfo della Morte,' the prelude of death. Leaving Rome, where,
"like the outpouring of the sewers, a flood of base desires invaded
every square and cross-road, ever more putrid and more swollen,"
D'Annunzio retired to Francovilla-al-Mare, a few miles from his
birthplace. There he lives in seclusion, esteemed by the
simple-minded, honest, and somewhat fanatical peasantry, to whose
quaint and primitive manners his books owe much of their
distinctive atmosphere.</p>
<p>In Italy, D'Annunzio's career has been watched with growing
interest. Until recently, however, he was scarcely known to the
world at large, when a few poems, translated into French, brought
his name into immediate prominence. Within a year three Paris
journals acquired rights of translation from him, and he has since
occupied the attention of such authoritative French critics as
Henri Rabusson, Ren&eacute; Doumic, Edouard Rod,
Eug&egrave;ne-Melchior de Vog&uuml;&eacute;, and, most recently,
Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re, all of whom seem to have a clearer
appreciation of his quality than even his critics at home. At the
same time there is a small but hostile minority among the French
novelists, whose literary feelings are voiced by L&eacute;on Daudet
in a vehement protest under the title 'Assez d'&Eacute;trangers'
(Enough of Foreigners).</p>
<p>It is too soon to pass final judgment on D'Annunzio's style,
which has been undergoing an obvious transition, not yet
accomplished. Realist and psychologist, symbolist and mystic by
turns, and first and always a poet, he has been compared
successively to Bourget and Maupassant, Tolstoi and
Dosto&iuml;evsky, Th&eacute;ophile Gautier and Catulle
Mend&egrave;s, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Baudelaire. Such
complexity of style is the outcome of his cosmopolitan taste in
literature, and his tendency to assimilate for future use whatever
pleases him in each successive author. Shakespeare and Goethe,
Keats and Heine, Plato and Zoroaster, figure among the names which
throng his pages; while his unacknowledged and often unconscious
indebtedness to writers of lesser magnitude,--notably the
self-styled 'Sar' Joseph Peladan--has lately raised an outcry of
plagiarism. Yet whatever leaves his pen, borrowed or original, has
received the unmistakable imprint of his powerful
individuality.</p>
<p>It is easy to trace the influences under which, successively,
D'Annunzio has come. They are essentially French. He is a French
writer in an Italian medium. His early short sketches, noteworthy
chiefly for their morbid intensity, were modeled largely on
Maupassant, whose frank, unblushing realism left a permanent
imprint upon the style of his admirer, and whose later analytic
tendency probably had an important share in turning his attention
to the psychological school.</p>
<p>'Il Piacere,' though largely inspired by Paul Bourget, contains
as large an element of 'Notre Coeur' and 'Bel-Ami' as of 'Le
Disciple' and 'Coeur de Femme.' In this novel, Andrea Sperelli
affords us the type of D'Annunzio's heroes, who, aside from
differences due to age and environment, are all essentially the
same,--somewhat weak, yet undeniably attractive; containing, all of
them, "something of a Don Juan and a Cherubini," with the Don Juan
element preponderating. The plot of 'Il Piacere' is not remarkable
either for depth or for novelty, being the needlessly detailed
record of Sperelli's relations with two married women, of totally
opposite types.</p>
<p>'Giovanni Episcopo' is a brief, painful tragedy of low life,
written under the influence of Russian evangelism, and full of
reminiscences of Dosto&iuml;evsky's 'Crime and Punishment.'
Giovanni is a poor clerk, of a weak, pusillanimous nature,
completely dominated by a coarse, brutal companion, Giulio Wanzer,
who makes him an abject slave, until a detected forgery compels
Wanzer to flee the country. Episcopo then marries Ginevra, the
pretty but unprincipled waitress at his <i>pension</i>, who
speedily drags him down to the lowest depths of degradation, making
him a mere nonentity in his own household, willing to live on the
proceeds of her infamy. They have one child, a boy, Ciro, on whom
Giovanni lavishes all his suppressed tenderness. After ten years of
this martyrdom, the hated Wanzer reappears and installs himself as
husband in the Episcopo household. Giovanni submits in helpless
fury, till one day Wanzer beats Ginevra, and little Ciro intervenes
to protect his mother. Wanzer turns on the child, and a spark of
manhood is at last kindled in Giovanni's breast. He springs upon
Wanzer, and with the pent-up rage of years stabs him.</p>
<p>'L'Innocente,' D'Annunzio's second long novel, also bears the
stamp of Russian influence. It is a gruesome, repulsive story of
domestic infidelity, in which he has handled the theory of pardon,
the motive of numerous recent French novels, like Daudet's 'La
Petite Paroisse' and Paul Marguerite's 'La Tourmente.'</p>
<p>In another extended work, 'Il Trionfo della Morte' (The Triumph
of Death), D'Annunzio appears as a convert to Nietzsche's
philosophy and to Wagnerianism. Ferdinand Bruneti&egrave;re has
pronounced it unsurpassed by the naturalistic schools of England,
France, or Russia. In brief, the hero, Giorgio Aurispa, a morbid
sensualist, with an inherited tendency to suicide, is led by fate
through a series of circumstances which keep the thought of death
continually before him. They finally goad him on to fling himself
from a cliff into the sea, dragging with him the woman he
loves.</p>
<p>The 'Vergini della Rocca' (Maidens of the Crag), his last story,
is more an idyllic poem than a novel. Claudio Cantelmo, sickened
with the corruption of Rome, retires to his old home in the
Abruzzi, where he meets the three sisters Massimilla, Anatolia,
Violante: "names expressive as faces full of light and shade, and
in which I seemed already to discover an infinity of grace, of
passion, and of sorrow." It is inevitable that he should chose one
of the three, but which? And in the d&eacute;nouement the solution
is only half implied.</p>
<p>D'Annunzio is now occupied with a new romance; and coming years
will doubtless present him all the more distinctively as a writer
of Italy on whom French inflences have been seed sowed in fertile
ground. The place in contemporary Italian of such work as his is
indisputably considerable.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="THE_DROWNED_BOY"></a>THE DROWNED BOY</h2>
<center>From 'The Triumph of Death'</center>
<br>
<p>All of a sudden, Albadora, the septuagenarian Cybele, she who
had given life to twenty-two sons and daughters, came toiling up
the narrow lane into the court, and indicating the neighboring
shore, where it skirted the promontory on the left, announced
breathlessly:--</p>
<p>"Down yonder there has been a child drowned!"</p>
<p>Candia made the sign of the cross. Giorgio arose and ascended to
the loggia, to observe the spot designated. Upon the sand, below
the promontory, in close vicinity to the chain of rocks and the
tunnel, he perceived a blotch of white, presumably the sheet which
hid the little body. A group of people had gathered around it.</p>
<p>As Ippolita had gone to mass with Elena at the chapel of the
Port, he yielded to his curiosity and said to his
entertainers:--</p>
<p>"I am going down to see."</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Candia. "Why do you wish to put a pain in your
heart?"</p>
<p>Hastening down the narrow lane, he descended by a short cut to
the beach, and continued along the water. Reaching the spot,
somewhat out of breath, he inquired:--</p>
<p>"What has happened?"</p>
<p>The assembled peasants saluted him and made way for him. One of
them answered tranquilly:--</p>
<p>"The son of a mother has been drowned."</p>
<p>Another, clad in linen, who seemed to be standing guard over the
corpse, bent down and drew aside the sheet.</p>
<p>The inert little body was revealed, extended upon the unyielding
sand. It was a lad, eight or nine years old, fair and frail, with
slender limbs. His head was supported on his few humble garments,
rolled up in place of pillow,--the shirt, the blue trousers, the
red sash, the cap of limp felt. His face was but slightly livid,
with flat nose, prominent forehead, and long, long lashes; the
mouth was half open, with thick lips which were turning blue,
between which the widely spaced teeth gleamed white. His neck was
slender, flaccid as a wilted stem, and seamed with tiny creases.
The jointure of the arms at the shoulder looked feeble. The arms
themselves were fragile, and covered with a down similar to the
fine plumage which clothes the bodies of newly hatched birds. The
whole outline of the ribs was distinctly visible; down the middle
of the breast the skin was divided by a darker line; the navel
stood out, like a knot. The feet, slightly bloated, had assumed the
same sallow color as the little hands, which were callous and
strewn with warts, with white nails beginning to turn livid. On the
left arm, on the thighs near the groin, and further down, on the
knees and along the legs, appeared reddish blotches of scurf. Every
detail of this wretched little body assumed, in the eyes of
Giorgio, an extraordinary significance, immobile as it was and
fixed forever in the rigidity of death.</p>
<p>"How was he drowned? Where?" he questioned, lowering his
voice.</p>
<p>The man dressed in linen gave, with some show of impatience, the
account which he had probably had to repeat too many times already.
He had a brutal countenance, square-cut, with bushy brows, and a
large mouth, harsh and savage. Only a little while after leading
the sheep back to their stalls, the lad, taking his breakfast along
with him, had gone down, together with a comrade, to bathe. He had
hardly set foot in the water, when he had fallen and was drowned.
At the cries of his comrade, some one from the house overhead on
the bluff had hurried down, and wading in up to the knees, had
dragged him from the water half dead; they had turned him upside
down to make him throw up the water, they had shaken him, but to no
purpose. To indicate just how far the poor little fellow had gone
in, the man picked up a pebble and threw it into the sea.</p>
<p>"There, only to there; at three yards from the shore!"</p>
<p>The sea lay at rest, breathing peacefully, close to the head of
the dead child. But the sun blazed fiercely down upon the sand; and
something pitiless, emanating from that sky of flame and from those
stolid witnesses, seemed to pass over the pallid corpse.</p>
<p>"Why," asked Giorgio, "do you not place him in the shade, in one
of the houses, on a bed?"</p>
<p>"He is not to be moved," declared the man on guard, "until they
hold the inquest."</p>
<p>"At least carry him into the shade, down there, below the
embankment!"</p>
<p>Stubbornly the man reiterated, "He is not to be moved."</p>
<p>There could be no sadder sight than that frail, lifeless little
being, extended on the stones, and watched over by the impassive
brute who repeated his account every time in the selfsame words,
and every time made the selfsame gesture, throwing a pebble into
the sea:--</p>
<p>"There; only to there."</p>
<p>A woman joined the group, a hook-nosed termagant, with gray eyes
and sour lips, mother of the dead boy's comrade. She manifested
plainly a mistrustful restlessness, as if she anticipated some
accusation against her own son. She spoke with bitterness, and
seemed almost to bear a grudge against the victim.</p>
<p>"It was his destiny. God had said to him, 'Go into the sea and
end yourself.'"</p>
<p>She gesticulated with vehemence. "What did he go in for, if he
did not know how to swim--?"</p>
<p>A young lad, a stranger in the district, the son of a mariner,
repeated contemptuously, "Yes, what did he go in for? We, yes, who
know how to swim--" ...</p>
<p>Other people joined the group, gazed with cold curiosity, then
lingered or passed on. A crowd occupied the railroad embankment,
another gathered on the crest of the promontory, as if at a
spectacle. Children, seated or kneeling, played with pebbles,
tossing them into the air and catching them, now on the back and
now in the hollow of their hands. They all showed the same profound
indifference to the presence of other people's troubles and of
death.</p>
<p>Another woman joined the group on her way home from mass,
wearing a dress of silk and all her gold ornaments. For her also
the harassed custodian repeated his account, for her also he
indicated the spot in the water. She was talkative.</p>
<p>"I am always saying to <i>my</i> children, 'Don't you go into
the water, or I will kill you!' The sea is the sea. Who can save
himself?"</p>
<p>She called to mind other instances of drowning; she called to
mind the case of the drowned man with the head cut off, driven by
the waves all the way to San Vito, and found among the rocks by a
child.</p>
<p>"Here, among these rocks. He came and told us, 'There is a dead
man there.' We thought he was joking. But we came and we found. He
had no head. They had an inquest; he was buried in a ditch; then in
the night he was dug up again. His flesh was all mangled and like
jelly, but he still had his boots on. The judge said, 'See, they
are better than mine!' So he must have been a rich man. And it
turned out that he was a dealer in cattle. They had killed him and
chopped off his head, and had thrown him into the Tronto."...</p>
<p>She continued to talk in her shrill voice, from time to time
sucking in the superfluous saliva with a slight hissing sound.</p>
<p>"And the mother? When is the mother coming?"</p>
<p>At that name there arose exclamations of compassion from all the
women who had gathered.</p>
<p>"The mother! There comes the mother, now!"</p>
<p>And all of them turned around, fancying that they saw her in the
far distance, along the burning strand. Some of the women could
give particulars about her. Her name was Riccangela; she was a
widow with seven children. She had placed this one in a farmer's
family, so that he might tend the sheep, and gain a morsel of
bread.</p>
<p>One woman said, gazing down at the corpse, "Who knows how much
pains the mother has taken in raising him!" Another said, "To keep
the children from going hungry she has even had to ask
charity."</p>
<p>Another told how, only a few months before, the unfortunate
child had come very near strangling to death in a courtyard in a
pool of water barely six inches deep. All the women repeated, "It
was his destiny. He was bound to die that way."</p>
<p>And the suspense of waiting rendered them restless, anxious.
"The mother! There comes the mother now!"</p>
<p>Feeling himself grow sick at heart, Giorgio exclaimed, "Can't
you take him into the shade, or into a house, so that the mother
will not see him here naked on the stones, under a sun like
this?"</p>
<p>Stubbornly the man on guard objected:--"He is not to be touched.
He is not to be moved--until the inquest is held."</p>
<p>The bystanders gazed in surprise at the stranger,--Candia's
stranger. Their number was augmenting. A few occupied the
embankment shaded with acacias; others crowned the promontory
rising abruptly from the rocks. Here and there, on the monstrous
bowlders, a tiny boat lay sparkling like gold at the foot of the
detached crag, so lofty that it gave the effect of the ruins of
some Cyclopean tower, confronting the immensity of the sea.</p>
<p>All at once, from above on the height, a voice announced, "There
she is."</p>
<p>Other voices followed:--"The mother! The mother!"</p>
<p>All turned. Some stepped down from the embankment. Those on the
promontory leaned far over. All became silent, in expectation. The
man on guard drew the sheet once more over the corpse. In the midst
of the silence, the sea barely seemed to draw its breath, the
acacias barely rustled. And then through the silence they could
hear her cries as she drew near.</p>
<p>The mother came along the strand, beneath the sun, crying aloud.
She was clad in widow's mourning. She tottered along the sand, with
bowed body, calling out, "O my son! My son!"</p>
<p>She raised her palms to heaven, and then struck them upon her
knees, calling out, "My son!"</p>
<p>One of her older sons, with a red handkerchief bound around his
neck, to hide some sore, followed her like one demented, dashing
aside his tears with the back of his hand. She advanced along the
strand, beating her knees, directing her steps toward the sheet.
And as she called upon her dead, there issued from her mouth sounds
scarcely human, but rather like the howling of some savage dog. As
she drew near, she bent over lower and lower, she placed herself
almost on all fours; till, reaching him, she threw herself with a
howl upon the sheet.</p>
<p>She arose again. With hand rough and toil-stained, hand
toughened by every variety of labor, she uncovered the body. She
gazed upon it a few instants, motionless as though turned to stone.
Then time and time again, shrilly, with all the power of her voice,
she called as if trying to awaken him, "My son! My son! My
son!"</p>
<p>Sobs suffocated her. Kneeling beside him, she beat her sides
furiously with her fists. She turned her despairing eyes around
upon the circle of strangers. During a pause in her paroxysms she
seemed to recollect herself. And then she began to sing. She sang
her sorrow in a rhythm which rose and fell continually, like the
palpitation of a heart. It was the ancient monody which from time
immemorial, in the land of the Abruzzi, the women have sung over
the remains of their relatives. It was the melodious eloquence of
sacred sorrow, which renewed spontaneously, in the profundity of
her being, this hereditary rhythm in which the mothers of bygone
ages had modulated their lamentations.</p>
<p>She sang on and on:--"Open your eyes, arise and walk, my son!
How beautiful you are! How beautiful you are!"</p>
<p>She sang on:--"For a morsel of bread I have drowned you, my son!
For a morsel of bread I have borne you to the slaughter! For that
have I raised you!"</p>
<p>But the irate woman with the hooked nose interrupted her:--"It
was not you who drowned him; it was Destiny. It was not you who
took him to the slaughter. You had placed him in the midst of
bread." And making a gesture toward the hill where the house stood
which had sheltered the lad, she added, "They kept him there, like
a pink at the ear."</p>
<p>The mother continued:--"O my son, who was it sent you; who was
it sent you here, to drown?"</p>
<p>And the irate woman:--"Who was it sent him? It was our Lord. He
said to him, 'Go into the water and end yourself.'"</p>
<p>As Giorgio was affirming in a low tone to one of the bystanders
that if succored in time the child might have been saved, and that
they had killed him by turning him upside down and holding him
suspended by the feet, he felt the gaze of the mother fixed upon
him. "Can't you do something for him, sir?" she prayed. "Can't you
do something for him?"</p>
<p>And she prayed:--"O Madonna of the Miracles, work a miracle for
him!"</p>
<p>Touching the head of the dead boy, she repeated:--"My son! my
son! my son! arise and walk!"</p>
<p>On his knees in front of her was the brother of the dead boy; he
was sobbing, but without grief, and from time to time he glanced
around with a face that suddenly grew indifferent. Another brother,
the oldest one, remained at a little distance, seated in the shade
of a bowlder; and he was making a great show of grief, hiding his
face in his hands. The women, striving to console the mother, were
bending over her with gestures of compassion, and accompanying her
monody with an occasional lament.</p>
<p>And she sang on:--"Why have I sent you forth from my house? Why
have I sent you to your death? I have done everything to keep my
children from hunger; everything, everything, except to be a woman
with a price. And for a morsel of bread I have lost you! This was
the way you were to die!"</p>
<p>Thereupon the woman with the hawk nose raised her petticoats in
an impetus of wrath, entered the water up to her knees, and
cried:--"Look! He came only to here. Look! The water is like oil.
It is a sign that he was bound to die that way."</p>
<p>With two strides she regained the shore. "Look!" she repeated,
pointing to the deep imprint in the sand made by the man who
recovered the body. "Look!"</p>
<p>The mother looked in a dull way; but it seemed as if she neither
saw nor comprehended. After her first wild outbursts of grief,
there came over her brief pauses, amounting to an obscurement of
consciousness. She would remain silent, she would touch her foot or
her leg with a mechanical gesture. Then she would wipe away her
tears with the black apron. She seemed to be quieting down. Then,
all of a sudden, a fresh explosion would shake her from head to
foot, and prostrate her upon the corpse.</p>
<p>"And I cannot take you away! I cannot take you in these arms to
the church! My son! My son!"</p>
<p>She fondled him from head to foot, she caressed him softly. Her
savage anguish was softened to an infinite tenderness. Her
hand--the burnt and callous hand of a hard-working woman--became
infinitely gentle as she touched the eyes, the mouth, the forehead
of her son.</p>
<p>"How beautiful you are! How beautiful you are!"</p>
<p>She touched his lower lip, already turned blue; and as she
pressed it slightly, a whitish froth issued from the mouth. From
between his lashes she brushed away some speck, very carefully, as
though fearful of hurting him.</p>
<p>"How beautiful you are, heart of your mamma!"</p>
<p>His lashes were long, very long, and fair. On his temples, on
his cheeks was a light bloom, pale as gold.</p>
<p>"Do you not hear me? Rise and walk."</p>
<p>She took the little well-worn cap, limp as a rag. She gazed at
it and kissed it, saying:--</p>
<p>"I am going to make myself a charm out of this, and wear it
always on my breast."</p>
<p>She lifted the child; a quantity of water escaped from the mouth
and trickled down upon the breast.</p>
<p>"O Madonna of the Miracles, perform a miracle!" she prayed,
raising her eyes to heaven in a supreme supplication. Then she laid
softly down again the little being who had been so dear to her, and
took up the worn shirt, the red sash, the cap. She rolled them up
together in a little bundle, and said:--</p>
<p>"This shall be my pillow; on these I shall rest my head, always,
at night; on these I wish to die."</p>
<p>She placed these humble relics on the sand, beside the head of
her child, and rested her temple on them, stretching herself out,
as if on a bed.</p>
<p>Both of them, mother and son, now lay side by side, on the hard
rocks, beneath the flaming sky, close to the homicidal sea. And now
she began to croon the very lullaby which in the past had diffused
pure sleep over his infant cradle.</p>
<p>She took up the red sash and said, "I want to dress him."</p>
<p>The cross-grained woman, who still held her ground, assented.
"Let us dress him now."</p>
<p>And she herself took the garments from under the head of the
dead boy; she felt in the jacket pocket and found a slice of bread
and a fig.</p>
<p>"Do you see? They had given him his food just before,--just
before. They cared for him like a pink at the ear."</p>
<p>The mother gazed upon the little shirt, all soiled and torn,
over which her tears fell rapidly, and said, "Must I put that shirt
on him?"</p>
<p>The other woman promptly raised her voice to some one of her
family, above on the bluff:--"Quick, bring one of Nufrillo's new
shirts!" The new shirt was brought. The mother flung herself down
beside him.</p>
<p>"Get up, Riccangela, get up!" solicited the women around
her.</p>
<p>She did not heed them. "Is my son to stay like that on the
stones, and I not stay there too?--like that, on the stones, my own
son?"</p>
<p>"Get up, Riccangela, come away."</p>
<p>She arose. She gazed once more with terrible intensity upon the
little livid face of the dead. Once again she called with all the
power of her voice, "My son! My son! My son!"</p>
<p>Then with her own hands she covered up with the sheet the
unheeding remains.</p>
<p>And the women gathered around her, drew her a little to one
side, under shadow of a bowlder; they forced her to sit down, they
lamented with her.</p>
<p>Little by little the spectators melted away. There remained only
a few of the women comforters; there remained the man clad in
linen, the impassive custodian, who was awaiting the inquest.</p>
<p>The dog-day sun poured down upon the strand, and lent to the
funeral sheet a dazzling whiteness. Amidst the heat the promontory
raised its desolate aridity straight upward from the tortuous chain
of rocks. The sea, immense and green, pursued its constant, even
breathing. And it seemed as if the languid hour was destined never
to come to an end.</p>
<p>Under shadow of the bowlder, opposite the white sheet, which was
raised up by the rigid form of the corpse beneath, the mother
continued her monody in the rhythm rendered sacred by all the
sorrows, past and present, of her race. And it seemed as if her
lamentation was destined never to come to an end.</p>

<h2><a name="ANTAR"></a>ANTAR</h2>
<h3>(About 550-615)</h3>

<br>

""></p>
<p>rabia was opened to English readers first by Sale's translation
of the 'Kuran,' in 1734; and by English versions of the 'Arabian
Nights' from 1712 onward. The latter were derived from Galland's
translation of the 'Thousand and One Nights,' which began to
appear, in French, in 1704. Next to nothing was generally known of
Oriental literature from that time until the end of the eighteenth
century. The East India Company fostered the study of the classics
of the extreme Orient; and the first Napoleon opened Egypt,--his
<i>savans</i> marched in the centre of the invading squares.</p>
<p>The flagship of the English fleet which blockaded Napoleon's
army carried an Austro-German diplomatist and scholar,--Baron von
Hammer-Purgstall,--part of whose mission was to procure a complete
manuscript of the 'Arabian Nights.' It was then supposed that these
tales were the daily food of all Turks, Arabians, and Syrians. To
the intense surprise of Von Hammer, he learned that they were never
recited in the coffee-houses of Constantinople, and that they were
not to be found at all outside of Egypt.</p>
<p>His dismay and disappointment were soon richly compensated,
however, by the discovery of the Arabian romance of 'Antar,' the
national classic, hitherto unknown in Europe, except for an
enthusiastic notice which had fallen by chance into the hands of
Sir William Jones. The entire work was soon collected. It is of
interminable length in the original, being often found in thirty or
forty manuscript volumes in quarto, in seventy or eighty in octavo.
Portions of it have been translated into English, German, and
French. English readers can consult it best in 'Antar,' a Bedouin
romance, translated from the Arabic by Terrick Hamilton, in four
volumes 8vo (London, 1820). Hamilton's translation, now rare,
covers only a portion of the original; and a new translation,
suitably abridged, is much needed.</p>
<p>The book purports to have been written more than a thousand
years ago,--in the golden prime of the Caliph
Har&uacute;n-al-Rashid (786-809) and of his sons and successors,
Amin (809-813) and Mamun (813-834),--by the famous As-Asmai (born
741, died about 830). It is in fact a later compilation, probably
of the twelth century. (Baron von Hammer's MS. was engrossed in the
year 1466.) Whatever the exact date may have been, it was probably
not much later than A.D. 1200. The main outlines of Antar's life
are historical. Many particulars are derived from historic accounts
of the lives of other Arabian heroes (Duraid and others) and are
transferred bodily to the biography of Antar. They date back to the
sixth century. Most of the details must be imaginary, but they are
skillfully contrived by a writer who knew the life of the desert
Arab at first hand. The verses with which the volumes abound are in
many cases undoubtedly Antar's. (They are printed in italics in
what follows.) In any event, the book in its present form has been
the delight of all Arabians for many centuries. Every wild Bedouin
of the desert knew much of the tale by heart, and listened to its
periods and to its poems with quivering interest. His more
cultivated brothers of the cities possessed one or many of its
volumes. Every coffee-house in Aleppo, Bagdad, or Constantinople
had a narrator who, night after night, recited it to rapt
audiences.</p>
<p>The unanimous opinion of the East has always placed the romance
of 'Antar' at the summit of such literature. As one of their
authors well says:--"'The Thousand and One Nights' is for the
amusement of women and children; 'Antar' is a book for men. From it
they learn lessons of eloquence, of magnanimity, of generosity, and
of statecraft." Even the prophet Muhammad, well-known foe to poetry
and to poets, instructed his disciples to relate to their children
the traditions concerning Antar, "for these will steel their hearts
harder than stone."</p>
<p>The book belongs among the great national classics, like the
'Shah-nameh' and the 'Nibelungen-Lied.' It has a direct relation to
Western culture and opinion also. Antar was the father of
knighthood. He was the <i>preux-chevalier</i>, the champion of the
weak and oppressed, the protector of women, the impassioned
lover-poet, the irresistible and magnanimous knight. European
chivalry in a marked degree is the child of the chivalry of his
time, which traveled along the shores of the Mediterranean Sea and
passed with the Moors into Spain (710). Another current flowed from
Arabia to meet and to modify the Greeks of Constantinople and the
early Crusaders; and still another passed from Persia into
Palestine and Europe. These fertilized Proven&ccedil;al poetry, the
French romance, the early Italian epic. The 'Shah-nameh' of
Firdausi, that model of a heroic poem, was written early in the
eleventh century. 'Antar' in its present form probably preceded the
romances of chivalry so common in the twelfth century in Italy and
France.</p>
<p>Antarah ben Shedad el Absi (Antar the Lion, the Son of Shedad of
the tribe of Abs), the historic Antar, was born about the middle of
the sixth century of our era, and died about the year 615,
forty-five years after the birth of the prophet Muhammad, and seven
years before the Hijra--the Flight to Medina--with which the
Muhammadan era begins. His father was a noble Absian knight. The
romance makes him the son of an Abyssinian slave, who is finally
discovered to be a powerful princess. His skin was black. He was
despised by his father and family and set to tend their camels. His
extraordinary strength and valor and his remarkable poetic faculty
soon made him a marked man, in a community in which personal valor
failed of its full value if it were not celebrated in brilliant
verse. His love for the beautiful Ibla (Ablah in the usual modern
form), the daughter of his uncle, was proved in hundreds of
encounters and battles; by many adventurous excursions in search of
fame and booty; by thousands of verses in her honor.</p>
<p>The historic Antar is the author of one of the seven "suspended
poems." The common explanation of this term is that these seven
poems were judged, by the assemblage of all the Arabs, worthy to be
written in golden letters (whence their name of the 'golden odes'),
and to be hung on high in the sacred Kaabah at Mecca. Whether this
be true, is not certain. They are at any rate accepted models of
Arabic style. Antar was one of the seven greatest poets of his
poetic race. These "suspended poems" can now be studied in the
original and in translation, by the help of a little book published
in London in 1894, 'The Seven Poems,' by Captain F.E. Johnson,
R.A.</p>
<p>The Antar of the romance is constantly breaking into verse which
is passionately admired by his followers. None of its beauties of
form are preserved in the translation; and indeed, this is true of
the prose forms also. It speaks volumes for the manly vigor of the
original that it can be transferred to an alien tongue and yet
preserve great qualities. To the Arab the work is a masterpiece
both in form and content. Its prose is in balanced, rhythmic
sentences ending in full or partial rhymes. This "cadence of the
cooing dove" is pure music to an Eastern ear. If any reader is
interested in Arabic verse, he can readily satisfy his curiosity.
An introduction to the subject is given in the Terminal Essay of
Sir Richard Burton's 'Arabian Nights' (Lady Burton's edition, Vol.
vi., page 340). The same subject is treated briefly and very
clearly in the introduction to Lyall's 'Ancient Arabian Poetry'--a
book well worth consulting on other accounts.</p>
<p>The story itself appeals to the Oriental's deepest feelings,
passions, ideals:--</p>
<p>"To realize the impetuous feelings of the Arab," says Von
Hammer, "you must have heard these tales narrated to a circle of
Bedouins crowded about the orator of the desert.... It is a
veritable drama, in which the spectators are the actors as well. If
the hero is threatened with imminent danger, they shudder and cry
aloud, 'No, no, no; Allah forbid! that cannot be!' If he is in the
midst of tumult and battle, mowing down rank after rank of the
enemy with his sword, they seize their own weapons and rise to fly
to his rescue. If he falls into the snares of treachery, their
foreheads contract with angry indignation and they exclaim, 'The
curse of Allah be on the traitor!' If the hero at last sinks under
the superior forces of the enemy, a long and ardent sigh escapes
from their breasts, with the farewell blessing, 'Allah's compassion
be with him--may he rest in peace.'... Descriptions of the beauties
of nature, especially of the spring, are received with
exclamations. Nothing equals the delight which sparkles in every
eye when the narrator draws a picture of feminine beauty."</p>
<p>The question as to the exact relation of the chivalry of Europe
to the earlier chivalry of Arabia and of the East is a large one,
and one which must be left to scholars. It is certain that Spenser
and Sir Philip Sidney owe far more to Saladin than we commonly
suppose. The tales of Boccaccio (1350) show that the Italians of
that day still held the Arabs to be their teachers in chivalry, and
at least their equals in art, science, and civilization; and the
Italy of 1300 was a century in advance of the rest of Europe. In
1268 two brothers of the King of Castile, with 800 other Spanish
gentlemen, were serving under the banners of the Muslim in Tunis.
The knightly ideal of both Moors and Spaniards was to be</p>
<blockquote>"Like steel among swords,<br>
Like wax among ladies."</blockquote>
<p>Hospitality, generosity, magnanimity, the protection of the
weak, punctilious observance of the plighted faith, pride of birth
and lineage, glory in personal valor--these were the knightly
virtues common to Arab and Christian warriors. Antar and his
knights, Ibla and her maidens, are the Oriental counterparts of
Launcelot and Arthur, of Guinevere and Iseult.</p>
<p>The primary duty of the early Arab was blood-revenge. An insult
to himself, or an injury to the tribe, must be wiped out with the
blood of the offender. Hence arose the multitude of tribal feuds.
It was Muhammad who first checked the private feud by fixing "the
price of blood" to be paid by the aggressor or by his tribe. In the
time of Antar revenge was the foremost duty. Ideals of excellence
change as circumstances alter. Virtues go out of fashion (like the
magnificence of Aristotle), or acquire an entirely new importance
(as veracity, since England became a trading nation). Some day we
may possess a natural history of the virtues.</p>
<p>The service of the loved one by the early Arab was a passion
completely different from the vain gallantry of the medi&aelig;val
knight of Europe. He sought for the complete possession of his
chosen mistress, and was eager to earn it by multitudes of
chivalric deeds; but he could not have understood the
sentimentalities of the Troubadours. The systematic fantasies of
the "Courts of Love" would have seemed cold follies to Arab
chivalry--as indeed they are, though they have led to something
better. In generosity, in magnanimity, the Arab knight far
surpassed his European brother. Hospitality was a point of honor to
both. As to the noble Arabs of those days, when any one demanded
their protection, no one ever inquired what was the matter; for if
he asked any questions, it would be said of him that he was afraid.
The poets have thus described them in verse:--</p>
<blockquote>"They rise when any one calls out to them, and<br>
they haste before asking any questions;<br>
they aid him against his enemies<br>
that seek his life, and they return<br>
honored to their families."</blockquote>
<p>The Arab was the knight of the tent and the desert. His deeds
were immediately known to his fellows; discussed and weighed in
every household of his tribe. The Christian knight of the Middle
Ages, living isolated in his stronghold, was less immediately
affected by the opinions of his class. Tribal allegiance was
developed in the first case, independence in the second.</p>
<p>Scholars tell us that the romance of 'Antar' is priceless for
faithful pictures of the times before the advent of Muhammad, which
are confirmed by all that remains of the poetry of "the days of
ignorance." To the general reader its charm lies in its bold and
simple stories of adventure; in its childlike enjoyment of the
beauty of Nature; in its pictures of the elemental passions of
ambition, pride, love, hate, revenge. Antar was a poet, a lover, a
warrior, a born leader. From a keeper of camels he rose to be the
protector of the tribe of Abs and the pattern of chivalry, by
virtue of great natural powers and in the face of every obstacle.
He won possession of his Ibla and gave her the dower of a queen, by
adventures the like of which were never known before. There were no
Ifrits or Genii to come to his aid, as in the 'Thousand Nights and
a Night.' 'Antar' is the epic of success crowning human valor; the
tales in the 'Arabian Nights,' at their best, are the fond fancies
of the fatalist whose best endeavor is at the mercy of every
capricious Jinni.</p>
<p>The 'Arabian Nights' contains one tale of the early Arabs,--the
story of Gharib and his brother Ajib,--which repeats some of the
exploits of Antar; a tale far inferior to the romance. The
excellences of the 'Arabian Nights' are of another order. We must
look for them in the pompous enchantments of the City of Brass, or
in the tender constancy of Aziz and Azizah, or in the tale of Hasan
of Bassorah, with its lovely study of the friendship of a
foster-sister, and its wonderful presentment of the magic
surroundings of the country of the Jann.</p>
<p>To select specimens from 'Antar' is like selecting from
'Robinson Crusoe.' In the romance, Antar's adventures go on and on,
and the character of the hero develops before one's eyes. It may be
that the leisure of the desert is needed fully to appreciate this
master-work.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_VALOR_OF_ANTAR"></a>THE VALOR OF ANTAR</h2>
<p>Now Antar was becoming a big boy, and grew up, and used to
accompany his mother, Zebeeba, to the pastures, and he watched the
cattle; and this he continued to do till he increased in stature.
He used to walk and run about to harden himself, till at length his
muscles were strengthened, his frame altogether more robust, his
bones more firm and solid, and his speech correct. His days were
passed in roaming about the mountain sides; and thus he continued
till he attained his tenth year.</p>
<p>[He now kills a wolf which had attacked his father's flocks, and
breaks into verse to celebrate his victory:--]</p>
<p><i>O thou wolf, eager for death, I have left thee wallowing in
dust, and spoiled of life; thou wouldst have the run of my flocks,
but I have left thee dyed with blood; thou wouldst disperse my
sheep, and thou knowest I am a lion that never fears. This is the
way I treat thee, thou dog of the desert. Hast thou ever before
seen battle and wars?</i></p>
<p>[His next adventure brought him to the notice of the chief of
the tribe,--King Zoheir. A slave of Prince Shas insulted a poor,
feeble woman who was tending her sheep; on which Antar "dashed him
against the ground. And his length and breadth were all one mass."
This deed won for Antar the hatred of Prince Shas, the friendship
of the gentle Prince Malik, and the praise of the king, their
father. "This valiant fellow," said the king, "has defended the
honor of women."]</p>
<p>From that day both King Zoheir and his son Malik conceived a
great affection for Antar, and as Antar returned home, the women
all collected around him to ask him what had happened; among them
were his aunts and his cousin, whose name was Ibla. Now Ibla was
younger than Antar, and a merry lass. She was lovely as the moon at
its full; and perfectly beautiful and elegant.... One day he
entered the house of his uncle Malik and found his aunt combing his
cousin Ibla's hair, which flowed down her back, dark as the shades
of night. Antar was quite surprised; he was greatly agitated, and
could pay no attention to anything; he was anxious and thoughtful,
and his anguish daily became more oppressive.</p>
<p>[Meeting her at a feast, he addressed her in verse:--]</p>
<p><i>The lovely virgin has struck my heart with the arrow of a
glance, for which there is no cure. Sometimes she wishes for a
feast in the sandhills, like a fawn whose eyes are full of magic.
She moves; I should say it was the branch of the Tamarisk that
waves its branches to the southern breeze. She approaches; I should
say it was the frightened fawn, when a calamity alarms it in the
waste</i>.</p>
<p>When Ibla heard from Antar this description of her charms, she
was in astonishment. But Antar continued in this state for days and
nights, his love and anguish ever increasing.</p>
<p>[Antar resolves to be either tossed upon the spear-heads or
numbered among the noble; and he wanders into the plain of
lions.]</p>
<p>As soon as Antar found himself in it, he said to himself,
Perhaps I shall now find a lion, and I will slay him. Then, behold
a lion appeared in the middle of the valley; he stalked about and
roared aloud; wide were his nostrils, and fire flashed from his
eyes; the whole valley trembled at every gnash of his fangs--he was
a calamity, and his claws more dreadful than the deadliest
catastrophe--thunder pealed as he roared--vast was his strength,
and his force dreadful--broad were his paws, and his head immense.
Just at that moment Shedad and his brothers came up. They saw Antar
address the lion, and heard the verses that he repeated; he sprang
forward like a hailstorm, and hissed at him like a black
serpent--he met the lion as he sprang and outroared his bellow;
then, giving a dreadful shriek, he seized hold of his mouth with
his hand, and wrenched it open to his shoulders, and he shouted
aloud--the valley and the country round echoed back the war.</p>
<p>[Those who were watching were astonished at his prowess, and
began to fear Antar. The horsemen now set off to attack the tribe
of Temeem, leaving the slaves to guard the women.]</p>
<p>Antar was in transports on seeing Ibla appear with the other
women. She was indeed like an amorous fawn; and when Antar was
attending her, he was overwhelmed in the ocean of his love, and
became the slave of her sable tresses. They sat down to eat, and
the wine-cups went merrily round. It was the spring of the year,
when the whole land shone in all its glory; the vines hung
luxuriantly in the arbors; the flowers shed around ambrosial
fragrance; every hillock sparkled in the beauty of its colors; the
birds in responsive melody sang sweetly from each bush, and harmony
issued from their throats; the ground was covered with flowers and
herbs; while the nightingales filled the air with their softest
notes.</p>
<p>[While the maidens were singing and sporting, lo! on a sudden
appeared a cloud of dust walling the horizon, and a vast clamor
arose. A troop of horses and their riders, some seventy in number,
rushed forth to seize the women, and made them prisoners. Antar
instantly rescues Ibla from her captors and engages the enemy.]</p>
<p>He rushed forward to meet them, and harder than flint was his
heart, and in his attack was their fate and destiny. He returned
home, taking with him five-and-twenty horses, and all the women and
children. Now the hatred of Semeeah (his stepmother) was converted
into love and tenderness, and he became dearer to her than
sleep.</p>
<p>[He had thenceforward a powerful ally in her, a fervent friend
in Prince Malik, a wily counselor in his brother Shiboob. And Antar
made great progress in Ibla's heart, from the verses that he spoke
in her praise; such verses as these:--]</p>
<p><i>I love thee with the love of a noble-born hero; and I am
content with thy imaginary phantom. Thou art my sovereign in my
very blood; and my mistress; and in thee is all my
confidence</i>.</p>
<p>[Antar's astonishing valor gained him the praise of the noble
Absian knights, and he was emboldened to ask his father Shedad to
acknowledge him for his son, that he might become a chief among the
Arabs. Shedad, enraged, drew his sword and rushed upon Antar to
kill him, but was prevented by Semeeah. Antar, in the greatest
agony of spirit, was ashamed that the day should dawn on him after
this refusal, or that he should remain any longer in the country.
He mounted his horse, put on his armor, and traveled on till he was
far from the tents, and he knew not whither he was going.]</p>
<p>Antar had proceeded some way, when lo! a knight rushed out from
the ravines in the rocks, mounted on a dark-colored colt, beautiful
and compact, and of a race much prized among the Arabs; his hoofs
were as flat as the beaten coin; when he neighed he seemed as if
about to speak, and his ears were like quills; his sire was Wasil
and his dam Hemama. When Antar cast his eye upon the horse, and
observed his speed and his paces, he felt that no horse could
surpass him, so his whole heart and soul longed for him. And when
the knight perceived that Antar was making toward him, he spurred
his horse and it fled beneath him; for this was a renowned horseman
called Harith, the son of Obad, and he was a valiant hero.</p>
<p>[By various devices Antar became possessed of the noble horse
Abjer, whose equal no prince or emperor could boast of. His mettle
was soon tried in an affray with the tribe of Maan, headed by the
warrior Nakid, who was ferocious as a lion.]</p>
<p>When Nakid saw the battle of Antar, and how alone he stood
against five thousand, and was making them drink of the cup of
death and perdition, he was overwhelmed with astonishment at his
deeds. "Thou valiant slave," he cried, "how powerful is thine
arm--how strong thy wrist!" And he rushed down upon Antar. And
Antar presented himself before him, for he was all anxiety to meet
him. "O thou base-born!" cried Nakid. But Antar permitted him not
to finish his speech, before he assaulted him with the assault of a
lion, and roared at him; he was horrified and paralyzed at the
sight of Antar. Antar attacked him, thus scared and petrified, and
struck him with his sword on the head, and cleft him down the back;
and he fell, cut in twain, from the horse, and he was split in two
as if by a balance; and as Antar dealt the blow he cried out, "Oh,
by Abs! oh, by Adnan! I am ever the lover of Ibla." No sooner did
the tribe of Maan behold Antar's blow, than every one was seized
with fear and dismay. The whole five thousand made an attack like
the attack of a single man; but Antar received them as the parched
ground receives the first of the rain. His eyeballs were fiery red,
and foam issued from his lips; whenever he smote he cleft the head;
every warrior he assailed, he annihilated; he tore a rider from the
back of his horse, he heaved him on high, and whirling him in the
air he struck down another with him, and the two instantly expired.
"By thine eyes, Ibla," he cried, "to-day will I destroy all this
race." Thus he proceeded until he terrified the warriors, and
hurled them into woe and disgrace, hewing off their arms and their
joints.</p>
<p>[At the moment of Antar's victory his friends arrive to see his
triumph. On his way back with them he celebrates his love for Ibla
in verses.]</p>
<p><i>When the breezes blow from Mount Saadi, their freshness calms
the fire of my love and transports.... Her throat complains of the
darkness of her necklaces. Alas! the effects of that throat and
that necklace! Will fortune ever, O daughter of Malik, ever bless
me with thy embrace, that would cure my heart of the sorrows of
love? If my eye could see her baggage camels, and her family, I
would rub my cheeks on the hoofs of her camels. I will kiss the
earth where thou art; mayhap the fire of my love and ecstasy may be
quenched.... I am the well-known Antar, the chief of his tribe, and
I shall die; but when I am gone, histories shall tell of
me</i>.</p>
<p>[From that day forth Antar was named Abool-fawaris, that is to
say, the father of horsemen. His sword, Dhami--the trenchant--was
forged from a meteor that fell from the sky; it was two cubits long
and two spans wide. If it were presented to Nushirvan, King of
Persia, he would exalt the giver with favors; or if it were
presented to the Emperor of Europe, one would be enriched with
treasures of gold and silver.]</p>
<p>As soon as Gheidac saw the tribe of Abs, and Antar the destroyer
of horsemen, his heart was overjoyed and he cried out, "This is a
glorious morning; to-day will I take my revenge." So he assailed
the tribe of Abs and Adnan, and his people attacked behind him like
a cloud when it pours forth water and rains. And the Knight of Abs
assaulted them likewise, anxious to try his sword, the famous
Dhami. And Antar fought with Gheidac, and wearied him, and shouted
at him, and filled him with horror; then assailed him so that
stirrup grated stirrup; and he struck him on the head with Dhami.
He cleft his visor and wadding, and his sword played away between
the eyes, passing through his shoulders down to the back of the
horse, even down to the ground; and he and his horse made four
pieces; and to the strictest observer, it would appear that he had
divided them with scales. And God prospered Antar in all that he
did, so that he slew all he aimed at, and overthrew all he
touched.</p>
<p>"Nobility," said Antar, "among liberal men, is the thrust of the
spear, the blow of the sword, and patience beneath the battle-dust.
I am the physician of the tribe of Abs in sickness, their protector
in disgrace, the defender of their wives when they are in trouble,
their horseman when they are in glory, and their sword when they
rush to arms."</p>
<p>[This was Antar's speech to Monzar, King of the Arabs, when he
was in search of Ibla's dowry. He found it in the land of Irak,
where the magnificent Chosroe was ready to reward him even to the
half of his kingdom, for his victory over the champion of the
Emperor of Europe.]</p>
<p>"All this grandeur, and all these gifts," said Antar, "have no
value to me, no charm in my eyes. Love of my native land is the
fixed passion of my soul."</p>
<p>"Do not imagine," said Chosroe, "that we have been able duly to
recompense you. What we have given you is perishable, as everything
human is, but your praises and your poems will endure forever."</p>
<p>[Antar's wars made him a Nocturnal Calamity to the foes of his
tribe. He was its protector and the champion of its women, "for
Antar was particularly solicitous in the cause of women." His
generosity knew no bounds. "Antar immediately presented the whole
of the spoil to his father and his uncles; and all the tribe of Abs
were astonished at his noble conduct and filial love." His
hospitality was universal; his magnanimity without limit. "Do not
bear malice, O Shiboob. Renounce it; for no good ever came of
malice. Violence is infamous; its result is ever uncertain, and no
one can act justly when actuated by hatred. Let my heart support
every evil, and let my patience endure till I have subdued all my
foes." Time after time he won new dowries for Ibla, even bringing
the treasures of Persia to her feet. Treacheries without count
divided him from his promised bride. Over and over again he rescued
her from the hands of the enemy; and not only her, but her father
and her hostile kinsmen.</p>
<p>At last (in the fourth volume, on the fourteen hundred and
fifty-third page) Antar makes his wedding feasts.]</p>
<p>"I wish to make at Ibla's wedding five separate feasts; I will
feed the birds and the beasts, the men and the women, the girls and
the boys, and not a single person shall remain in the whole country
but shall eat at Ibla's marriage festival."</p>
<p>Antar was at the summit of his happiness and delight,
congratulating himself on his good fortune and perfect felicity,
all trouble and anxiety being now banished from his heart. Praise
be to God, the dispenser of all grief from the hearts of virtuous
men.</p>
<p>[The three hundred and sixty tribes of the Arabs were invited to
the feast, and on the eighth day the assembled chiefs presented
their gifts--horses, armor, slaves, perfumes, gold, velvet, camels.
The number of slaves Antar received that day was five-and-twenty
hundred, to each of whom he gave a damsel, a horse, and weapons.
And they all mounted when he rode out, and halted when he
halted.]</p>
<p>Now when all the Arab chiefs had presented their offerings, each
according to his circumstances, Antar rose, and called out to
Mocriul-Wahsh:--"O Knight of Syria," said he, "let all the he and
she camels, high-priced horses, and all the various rarities I have
received this day, be a present from me to you. But the perfumes of
ambergris, and fragrant musk, belong to my cousin Ibla; and the
slaves shall form my army and troops." And the Arab chiefs marveled
at his generosity....</p>
<p>And now Ibla was clothed in the most magnificent garments, and
superb necklaces; they placed the coronet of Chosroe on her head,
and tiaras round her forehead. They lighted brilliant and scented
candles before her--the perfumes were scattered--the torches
blazed--and Ibla came forth in state. All present gave a shout;
while the malicious and ill-natured cried aloud, "What a pity that
one so beautiful and fair should be wedded to one so black!"</p>
<p>[The selections are from Hamilton's translation. Two long
episodes in 'Antar' are especially noteworthy: the famous horse
race between the champions of the tribes of Abs and Fazarah (Vol.
iv., Chapter 33), and the history of Khalid and Jaida (Vol. ii.,
Chapter 11).]</p>

<h2><a name="LUCIUS_APULEIUS"></a>LUCIUS APULEIUS</h2>
<h3>(Second Century A. D.)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-l.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ucius Apuleius, author of the brilliant Latin novel 'The
Metamorphoses,' also called 'The [Golden] Ass,'--and more generally
known under that title,--will be remembered when many greater
writers shall have been forgotten. The downfall of Greek political
freedom brought a period of intellectual development fertile in
prose story-telling,--short fables and tales, novels philosophic
and religious, historical and satiric, novels of love, novels of
adventure. Yet, strange to say, while the instinct was prolific in
the Hellenic domain of the Roman Empire, it was for the most part
sterile in Italy, though Roman life was saturated with the
influence of Greek culture. Its only two notable examples are
Petronius Arbiter and Apuleius, both of whom belong to the first
two centuries of the Christian epoch.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-132.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>Apuleius</b></p>
<p>The suggestion of the plan of the novel familiarly known as 'The
Golden Ass' was from a Greek source, Lucius of Patr&aelig;. The
original version was still extant in the days of Photius, Patriarch
of the Greek Church in the ninth century. Lucian, the Greek
satirist, also utilized the same material in a condensed form in
his 'Lucius, or the Ass.' But Apuleius greatly expanded the legend,
introduced into it numerous episodes, and made it the background of
a vivid picture of the manners and customs of a corrupt age. Yet
underneath its lively portraiture there runs a current of mysticism
at variance with the na&iuml;ve rehearsal of the hero's adventures,
and this has tempted critics to find a hidden meaning in the story.
Bishop Warburton, in his 'Divine Legation of Moses,' professes to
see in it a defense of Paganism at the expense of struggling
Christianity. While this seems absurd, it is fairly evident that
the mind of the author was busied with something more than the mere
narration of rollicking adventure, more even than a satire on Roman
life. The transformation of the hero into an ass, at the moment
when he was plunging headlong into a licentious career, and the
recovery of his manhood again through divine intervention, suggest
a serious symbolism. The beautiful episode of 'Cupid and Psyche,'
which would lend salt to a production far more corrupt, is also
suggestive. Apuleius perfected this wild flower of ancient
folk-lore into a perennial plant that has blossomed ever since
along the paths of literature and art. The story has been accepted
as a fitting embodiment of the struggle of the soul toward a higher
perfection; yet, strange to say, the episode is narrated with as
brutal a realism as if it were a satire of Lucian, and its style is
belittled with petty affectations of rhetoric. It is the enduring
beauty of the conception that has continued to fascinate. Hence we
may say of 'The Golden Ass' in its entirety, that whether readers
are interested in esoteric meanings to be divined, or in the
author's vivid sketches of his own period, the novel has a charm
which long centuries have failed to dim.</p>
<p>Apuleius was of African birth and of good family, his mother
having come of Plutarch's blood. The second century of the Roman
Empire, when he lived (he was born at Madaura about A. D. 139), was
one of the most brilliant periods in history,--brilliant in its
social gayety, in its intellectual activities, and in the splendor
of its achievements. The stimulus of the age spurred men far in
good and evil. Apuleius studied at Carthage, and afterward at Rome,
both philosophy and religion, though this bias seems not to have
dulled his taste for worldly pleasure. Poor in purse, he finally
enriched himself by marrying a wealthy widow and inheriting her
property. Her will was contested on the ground that this handsome
and accomplished young literary man had exercised magic in winning
his elderly bride! The successful defense of Apuleius before his
judges--a most diverting composition, so jaunty and full of witty
impertinences that it is evident he knew the hard-headed Roman
judges would dismiss the prosecution as a farce--is still extant
under the name of 'The Apology; or, Concerning Magic.' This in
after days became oddly jumbled with the story of 'The Golden Ass'
and its transformations, so that St. Augustine was inclined to
believe Apuleius actually a species of professional wizard.</p>
<p>The plot of 'The Golden Ass' is very simple. Lucius of Madaura,
a young man of property, sets out on his travels to sow his wild
oats. He pursues this pleasant occupation with the greatest zeal
according to the prevailing mode: he is no moralist. The partner of
his first intrigue is the maid of a woman skilled in witchcraft.
The curiosity of Lucius being greatly exercised about the sorceress
and her magic, he importunes the girl to procure from her mistress
a magic salve which will transform him at will into an owl. By
mistake he receives the wrong salve; and instead of the bird
metamorphosis which he had looked for, he undergoes an unlooked-for
change into an ass. In this guise, and in the service of various
masters, he has opportunities of observing the follies of men from
a novel standpoint. His adventures are numerous, and he hears many
strange stories, the latter being chronicled as episodes in the
record of his experiences. At last the goddess Isis appears in a
dream, and obligingly shows him the way to effect his second
metamorphosis, by aid of the high priest of her temple, where
certain mysteries are about to be celebrated. Lucius is freed from
his disguise, and is initiated into the holy rites.</p>
<p>'The Golden Ass' is full of dramatic power and variety. The
succession of incident, albeit grossly licentious at times, engages
the interest without a moment's dullness. The main narrative,
indeed, is no less entertaining than the episodes. The work became
a model for story-writers of a much later period, even to the times
of Fielding and Smollett. Boccaccio borrowed freely from it; at
least one of the many humorous exploits of Cervantes's 'Don
Quixote' can be attributed to an adventure of Lucius; while 'Gil
Blas' abounds in reminiscences of the Latin novel. The student of
folk-lore will easily detect in the tasks imposed by Venus on her
unwelcome daughter-in-law, in the episode of 'Cupid and Psyche,'
the possible original from which the like fairy tales of Europe
drew many a suggestion. Probably Apuleius himself was indebted to
still earlier Greek sources.</p>
<p>Scarcely any Latin production was more widely known and studied
from the beginning of the Italian Renaissance to the middle of the
seventeenth century. In its style, however, it is far from classic.
It is full of archaisms and rhetorical conceits. In striving to say
things finely, the author frequently failed to say them well. This
fault, however, largely disappears in the translation; and whatever
may be the literary defects of the novel, it offers rich
compensation in the liveliness, humor, and variety of its
substance.</p>
<p>In addition to 'The Golden Ass,' the extant writings of Apuleius
include 'Florida' (an anthology from his own works), 'The God of
Socrates,' 'The Philosophy of Plato,' and 'Concerning the World,' a
treatise once attributed to Aristotle. The best modern edition of
his complete works is that of Hildebrand (Leipzig, 1842); of the
'Metamorphoses,' that of Eyssenhardt (Berlin, 1869). There have
been many translations into the modern languages. The best English
versions are those of T. Taylor (London, 1822); of Sir G. Head,
somewhat expurgated (London, 1851); and an unsigned translation
published in the Bohn Library, which has been drawn on for this
work, but greatly rewritten as too stiff and prolix, and in the
conversations often wholly unnatural. A very pretty edition in
French, with many illustrations, is that of Saval&egrave;te (Paris,
1872).</p>

"THE_TALE_OF_ARISTOMENES,_THE_COMMERCIAL_TRAVELER"></a>THE TALE OF
ARISTOMENES, THE COMMERCIAL TRAVELER</h2>
<center>From 'The Metamorphoses'</center>
<br>
<p>I am a native of &AElig;gina, and I travel in Thessaly,
&AElig;tolia, and Boeotia to purchase honey of Hypata, cheese, and
other articles used in cookery. Having heard that at Hypata, the
principal city of Thessaly, fine-flavored new cheese was for sale
cheap, I made the best of my way there to buy it all up. But as
usual, happening to start left foot foremost, which is unlucky, all
my hopes of profit came to nothing; for a fellow named Lupus, a
merchant who does things on a big scale, had bought the whole of it
the day before.</p>
<p>Weary with my hurried journey to no purpose, I was going early
in the evening to the public baths, when to my surprise I espied an
old companion of mine named Socrates. He was sitting on the ground,
half covered with a rag-tag cloak, and looking like somebody else,
he was so miserably wan and thin,--in fact, just like a street
beggar; so that though he used to be my friend and close
acquaintance, I had two minds about speaking to him.</p>
<p>"How now, friend Socrates!" said I: "what does this mean? Why
are you tricked out like this? What crime have you been guilty of?
Why, you look as though your family had given you up for dead and
held your funeral long ago, the probate judge had appointed
guardians for your children, and your wife, disfigured by her long
mourning, having cried herself almost blind, was being worried by
her parents to sit up and take notice of things, and look for a new
marriage. Yet now, all of a sudden, here you come before us like a
wretched ghost from the dead, to turn everything upside down.'"</p>
<p>"O Aristomenes!" said he, "it's clear that you don't know the
slippery turns, the freaks, and the never-ending tricks of
fortune."</p>
<p>As he said this, he hid his face, crimson with shame, in his one
garment of patches and tatters. I could not bear such a miserable
sight, and tried to raise him from the ground. But he kept saying
with his head all covered up, "Let me alone! let me alone! let
Fortune have her way with me!"</p>
<p>However, I finally persuaded him to go with me; and at the same
time pulling off one of my own garments, I speedily clothed him, or
at any rate covered him. I next took him to a bath, scrubbed and
oiled him myself, and laboriously rubbed the matted dirt off him.
Having done all I could, though tired out myself, I supported his
feeble steps, and with great difficulty brought him to my inn.
There I made him lie down on a bed, gave him plenty of food, braced
him up with wine, and entertained him with the news of the day.
Pretty soon our conversation took a merry turn; we cracked jokes,
and grew noisy as we chattered. All of a sudden, heaving a bitter
sigh from the bottom of his chest, and striking his forehead
violently with his right hand, he said:--</p>
<p>"Miserable wretch that I am, to have got into such a predicament
while having a good time at a gladiatorial show! As you know, I
went to Macedonia on business; it took me ten months; I was on my
way home with a very neat sum of money, and had nearly reached
Larissa, which I included in my route in order to see the show I
mentioned, when I was attacked by robbers in a lonely valley, and
only escaped after losing everything I had. In my distress I betook
myself to a certain woman named Mero&euml;, who kept a tavern (and
who, though rather old, was very good-looking), and told her about
my long absence, my earnest desire to reach home, and my being
robbed that very day. She treated me with the greatest kindness,
gave me a good supper for nothing, and then let me make love to
her. But from the very moment that I was such a fool as to dally
with her, my mind seemed to desert me. I even gave her the clothes
which the robbers in common decency had left me, and the little
earnings I made there by working as cloakmaker so long as I was in
good physical condition; until at length this kind friend, and bad
luck together, reduced me to the state you just now found me
in."</p>
<p>"By Pollux, then," said I, "you deserve to suffer the very worst
misfortunes (if there be anything worse than the worst), for having
preferred a wrinkled old reprobate to your home and children."</p>
<p>"Hush! hush!" said he, putting his forefinger on his lips, and
looking round with a terror-stricken face to see if we were alone.
"Beware of reviling a woman skilled in the black art, for fear of
doing yourself a mischief."</p>
<p>"Say you so?" said I. "What kind of a woman is this innkeeper,
so powerful and dreadful?"</p>
<p>"She is a sorceress," he replied, "and possessed of magic
powers; she can draw down the heavens, make the earth heave, harden
the running water, dissolve mountains, raise the shades of the
dead, dethrone the gods, extinguish the stars, and set the very
depths of Tartarus ablaze!"</p>
<p>"Come, come!" said I: "end this tragic talk, fold up your
theatrical drop-scenes, and let us hear your story in every-day
language."</p>
<p>"Should you like," said he, "to hear of one or two, yes, or a
great many of her performances? Why, to make not only her
fellow-countrymen, but the Indians, the Ethiopians, or even the
Antipodeans, love her to distraction, are only the easy lessons of
her art, as it were, and mere trifles. Listen to what she has done
before many witnesses. By a single word she changed a lover into a
beaver, because he had gone to another flame. She changed an
innkeeper, a neighbor of hers she was envious of, into a frog; and
now the old fellow, swimming about in a cask of his own wine, or
buried in the dregs, croaks hoarsely to his old customers,--quite
in the way of business. She changed another person, a lawyer from
the Forum, into a ram, because he had conducted a suit against her;
to this very day that ram is always butting about. Finally,
however, public indignation was aroused by so many people coming to
harm through her arts; and the very next day had been fixed upon to
wreak a fearful vengeance on her, by stoning her to death. She
frustrated the design by her enchantments. You remember how Medea,
having got Creon to allow her just one day before her departure,
burned his whole palace, with himself and his daughter in it, by
means of flames issuing from a garland? Well, this sorceress,
having performed certain deadly incantations in a ditch (she told
me so herself in a drunken fit), confined everybody in the town
each in his own house for two whole days, by a secret spell of the
demons. The bars could not be wrenched off, nor the doors taken off
the hinges, nor even a breach made in the walls. At last, by common
consent, the people all swore they would not lift a hand against
her, and would come to her defense if any one else did. She then
liberated the whole city. But in the middle of the night she
conveyed the author of the conspiracy, with all his house, close
barred as it was,--the walls, the very ground, and even the
foundations,--to another city a hundred miles off, on the top of a
craggy mountain, and so without water. And as the houses of the
inhabitants were built so close together that there was not room
for the new-comer, she threw down the house before the gate of the
city and took her departure."</p>
<p>"You narrate marvelous things," said I, "my good Socrates; and
no less terrible than marvelous. In fact, you have excited no small
anxiety (indeed I may say fear) in me too; not a mere grain of
apprehension, but a piercing dread for fear this old hag should
come to know our conversation in the same way, by the help of some
demon. Let us get to bed without delay; and when we have rested
ourselves by a little sleep, let us fly as far as we possibly can
before daylight."</p>
<p>While I was still advising him thus, the worthy Socrates,
overcome by more wine than he was used to and by his fatigue, had
fallen asleep and was snoring loudly. I shut the door, drew the
bolts, and placing my bed close against the hinges, tossed it up
well and lay down on it. I lay awake some time through fear, but
closed my eyes at last a little before midnight.</p>
<p>I had just fallen asleep, when suddenly the door was burst open
with such violence that it was evidently not done by robbers; the
hinges were absolutely broken and wrenched off, and it was thrown
to the ground. The small bedstead, minus one foot and rotten, was
also upset by the shock; and falling upon me, who had been rolled
out on the floor, it completely covered and hid me. Then I
perceived that certain emotions can be excited by exactly opposite
causes; for as tears often come from joy, so, in spite of my
terror, I could not help laughing to see myself turned from
Aristomenes into a tortoise. As I lay on the floor, completely
covered by the bed, and peeping out to see what was the matter, I
saw two old women, one carrying a lighted lamp and the other a
sponge and a drawn sword, plant themselves on either side of
Socrates, who was fast asleep.</p>
<p>The one with the sword said to the other:--"This, sister
Panthea, is my dear Endymion, my Ganymede, who by day and by night
has laughed my youth to scorn. This is he who, despising my
passion, not only defames me with abusive language, but is
preparing also for flight; and I forsooth, deserted through the
craft of this Ulysses, like another Calypso, am to be left to
lament in eternal loneliness!"</p>
<p>Then extending her right hand, and pointing me out to her friend
Panthea:--</p>
<p>"And there," said she, "is his worthy counselor, Aristomenes,
who was the planner of this flight, and who now, half dead, is
lying flat on the ground under the bedstead and looking at all that
is going on, while he fancies that he is to tell scandalous stories
of me with impunity. I'll take care, however, that some day, aye,
and before long, too,--this very instant, in fact,--he shall repent
of his recent chatter and his present curiosity."</p>
<p>On hearing this I felt myself streaming with cold perspiration,
and my heart began to throb so violently that even the bedstead
danced on my back.</p>
<p>"Well, sister," said the worthy Panthea, "shall we hack him to
pieces at once, like the Bacchanals, or tie his limbs and mutilate
him?"</p>
<p>To this Mero&euml; replied,--and I saw from what was happening,
as well as from what Socrates had told, how well the name fitted
her,--"Rather let him live, if only to cover the body of this
wretched creature with a little earth."</p>
<p>Then, moving Socrates's head to one side, she plunged the sword
into his throat up to the hilt, catching the blood in a small
leathern bottle so carefully that not a drop of it was to be seen.
All this I saw with my own eyes. The worthy Mero&euml;--in order, I
suppose, not to omit any due observance in the sacrifice of the
victim--then thrust her right hand through the wound, and drew
forth the heart of my unhappy companion. His windpipe being
severed, he emitted a sort of indistinct gurgling noise, and poured
forth his breath with his bubbling blood. Panthea then stopped the
gaping wound with a sponge, exclaiming, "Beware, O sea-born sponge,
how thou dost pass through a river!"</p>
<p>When she had said this, they lifted my bed from the ground, and
dashed over me a mass of filth.</p>
<p>Hardly had they passed over the threshold when the door resumed
its former state. The hinges settled back on the panels, the posts
returned to the bars, and the bolts flew back to their sockets
again. I lay prostrate on the ground in a squalid plight,
terrified, naked, cold, and drenched. Indeed, I was half dead,
though still alive; and pursued a train of reflections like one
already in the grave, or to say the least on the way to the cross,
to which I was surely destined. "What," said I, "will become of me,
when this man is found in the morning with his throat cut? If I
tell the truth, who will believe a word of the story? 'You ought at
least,' they will say, 'to have called for help, if as strong a man
as you are could not withstand a woman! Is a man's throat to be cut
before your eyes, and you keep silence? Why was it that you were
not assassinated too? How did the villains come to spare you, a
witness of the murder? They would naturally kill you, if only to
put an end to all evidence of the crime. Since your escape from
death was against reason, return to it.'"</p>
<p>I said these things to myself over and over again, while the
night was fast verging toward day. It seemed best to me, therefore,
to escape on the sly before daylight and pursue my journey, though
I was all in a tremble. I took up my bundle, put the key in the
door, and drew back the bolts. But this good and faithful door,
which had opened of its own accord in the night, would not open now
till I had tried the key again and again.</p>
<p>"Hallo, porter!" said I, "where are you? Open the gate, I want
to be off before daybreak."</p>
<p>The porter, who was lying on the ground behind the door, only
grunted, "Why do you want to begin a journey at this time of night?
Don't you know the roads are infested by robbers? You may have a
mind to meet your death,--perhaps your conscience stings you for
some crime you have committed; but I haven't a head like a pumpkin,
that I should die for your sake!"</p>
<p>"It isn't very far from daybreak," said I; "and besides, what
can robbers take from a traveler in utter poverty? Don't <i>you</i>
know, you fool, that a naked man can't be stripped by ten
athletes?"</p>
<p>The drowsy porter turned over and answered;--"And how am I to
know but what you have murdered that fellow-traveler of yours that
you came here with last night, and are running away to save
yourself? And now I remember that I saw Tartarus through a hole in
the earth just at that hour, and Cerberus looking ready to eat me
up."</p>
<p>Then I came to the conclusion that the worthy Mero&euml; had not
spared my throat out of pity, but to reserve me for the cross. So,
on returning to my chamber, I thought over some speedy method of
putting an end to myself; but fortune had provided me with no
weapon for self-destruction, except the bedstead. "Now, bedstead,"
said I, "most dear to my soul, partner with me in so many sorrows,
fully conscious and a spectator of this night's events, and whom
alone when accused I can adduce as a witness of my innocence--do
thou supply me (who would fain hasten to the shades below) a
welcome instrument of death."</p>
<p>Thus saying, I began to undo the bed-cord. I threw one end of it
over a small beam projecting above the window, fastened it there,
and made a slip-knot at the other end. Then I mounted on the bed,
and thus elevated for my own destruction, put my head into the
noose and kicked away my support with one foot; so that the noose,
tightened about my throat by the strain of my weight, might stop my
breath. But the rope, which was old and rotten, broke in two; and
falling from aloft, I tumbled heavily upon Socrates, who was lying
close by, and rolled with him on the floor.</p>
<p>Lo and behold! at that very instant the porter burst into the
room, bawling out, "Where are you, you who were in such monstrous
haste to be off at midnight, and now lie snoring, rolled up in the
bed-clothes?"</p>
<p>At these words--whether awakened by my fall or by the rasping
voice of the porter, I know not--Socrates was the first to start
up; and he exclaimed, "Evidently travelers have good reason for
detesting these hostlers. This nuisance here, breaking in without
being asked,--most likely to steal something,--has waked me out of
a sound sleep by his outrageous bellowing."</p>
<p>On hearing him speak I jumped up briskly, in an ecstasy of
unhoped-for joy:--"Faithfulest of porters," I exclaimed, "my
friend, my own father, and my brother,--behold him whom you, in
your drunken fit, falsely accuse me of having murdered."</p>
<p>So saying, I embraced Socrates, and was for loading him with
kisses; but he repulsed me with considerable violence. "Get out
with you!" he cried. Sorely confused, I trumped up some absurd
story on the spur of the moment, to give another turn to the
conversation, and taking him by the right hand--</p>
<p>"Why not be off," said I, "and enjoy the freshness of the
morning on our journey?"</p>
<p>So I took my bundle, and having paid the innkeeper for our
night's lodging, we started on our road.</p>
<p>We had gone some little distance, and now, everything being
illumined by the beams of the rising sun, I keenly and attentively
examined that part of my companion's neck into which I had seen the
sword plunged.</p>
<p>"Foolish man," said I to myself, "buried in your cups, you
certainly have had a most absurd dream. Why, look: here's Socrates,
safe, sound, and hearty. Where is the wound? Where is the sponge?
Where is the scar of a gash so deep and so recent?"</p>
<p>Addressing myself to him, I remarked, "No wonder the doctors say
that hideous and ominous dreams come only to people stuffed with
food and liquor. My own case is a good instance. I went beyond
moderation in my drinking last evening, and have passed a wretched
night full of shocking and dreadful visions, so that I still fancy
myself spattered and defiled with human gore."</p>
<p>"It is not gore," he replied with a smile, "that you are
sprinkled with. And yet in my sleep I thought my own throat was
being cut, and felt some pain in my neck, and fancied that my very
heart was being plucked out. Even now I am quite faint; my knees
tremble; I stagger as I go, and feel in want of some food to
hearten me up."</p>
<p>"Look," cried I, "here is breakfast all ready for you." So
saying, I lifted my wallet from my shoulders, handed him some bread
and cheese, and said, "Let us sit down near that plane-tree." We
did so, and I helped myself to some refreshment. While looking at
him more closely, as he was eating with a voracious appetite, I saw
that he was faint, and of a hue like boxwood. His natural color, in
fact, had so forsaken him, that as I recalled those nocturnal
furies to my frightened imagination, the very first piece of bread
I put in my mouth, though exceedingly small, stuck in the middle of
my throat and would pass neither downward nor upward. Besides, the
number of people passing along increased my fears; for who would
believe that one of two companions could meet his death except at
the hands of the other?</p>
<p>Presently, after having gorged himself with food, he began to be
impatient for some drink, for he had bolted the larger part of an
excellent cheese. Not far from the roots of the plane-tree a gentle
stream flowed slowly along, like a placid lake, rivaling silver or
crystal.</p>
<p>"Look," said I: "drink your fill of the water of this stream,
bright as the Milky Way."</p>
<p>He arose, and, wrapping himself in his cloak, with his knees
doubled under him, knelt down upon the shelving bank and bent
greedily toward the water. Scarcely had he touched its surface with
his lips, when the wound in his throat burst open and the sponge
rolled out, a few drops of blood with it; and his lifeless body
would have fallen into the river had I not laid hold of one of his
feet, and dragged him with great difficulty and labor to the top of
the bank. There, having mourned my hapless comrade as much as there
was time, I buried him in the sandy soil that bordered the stream.
Then, trembling and terror-stricken, I fled through various
unfrequented places; and as though guilty of homicide, abandoned my
country and my home, embraced a voluntary exile, and now dwell in
&AElig;tolia, where I have married another wife.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_AWAKENING_OF_CUPID"></a>THE AWAKENING OF
CUPID</h2>
<br>
<blockquote>[The radical difference in the constituent parts of the
'Golden Ass' is startling, and is well illustrated by the selection
given previously and that which follows. The story of the "drummer"
comports exactly with the modern idea of realism in fiction: a
vivid and unflinching picture of manners and morals, full of broad
coarse humor and worldly wit. The story of Cupid and Psyche is the
purest, daintiest, most poetic of fancies; in essence a fairy tale
that might be told of an evening by the fire-light in the second
century or the nineteenth, but embodying also a high and beautiful
allegory, and treated with a delicate art which is in extreme
contrast with the body of the 'Golden Ass.' The difference is
almost as striking as between Gray's lampoon on "Jemmy Twitcher"
and his 'Bard' or 'Elegy'; or between Aristophanes's revels in
filth and his ecstatic soarings into the heavenliest regions of
poetry.</blockquote>
<p>The contrast is even more rasping when we remember that the tale
is not put into the mouth of a girl gazing dreamily into the
glowing coals on the hearth, or of some elegant reciter amusing a
social group in a Roman drawing-room or garden, but of a grizzled
hag who is maid of all work in a robbers' cave. She tells it to
divert the mind of a lovely young bride held for ransom. It begins
like a modern fairy tale, with a great king and queen who had
"three daughters of remarkable beauty," the loveliest being the
peerless Psyche. Even Venus becomes envious of the honors paid to
Psyche's charms, and summons Cupid to wing one of his shafts which
shall cause her "to be seized with the most burning love for the
lowest of mankind," so as to disgrace and ruin her. Cupid
undertakes the task, but instead falls in love with her himself.
Meanwhile an oracle from Apollo, instigated by Venus, dooms her to
be sacrificed in marriage to some unknown a&euml;rial monster, who
must find her alone on a naked rock. She is so placed, awaiting her
doom in terror; but the zephyrs bear her away to the palace of
Love. Cupid hides her there, lest Venus wreak vengeance on them
both: and there, half terrified but soon soothed, in the darkness
of night she hears from Cupid that he, her husband, is no monster,
but the fairest of immortals. He will not disclose his identity,
however; not only so, but he tenderly warns her that she must not
seek to discover it, or even to behold him, till he gives
permission, unless she would bring hopeless disaster on both. Nor
must she confide in her two sisters, lest their unwisdom or sudden
envy cause harm.</p>
<p>The simple-hearted and affectionate girl, however, in her
craving for sympathy, cannot resist the temptation to boast of her
happiness to her sisters. She invites them to pass a day in her
magnificent new home, and tells contradictory stories about her
husband. Alas! they depart bitterly envious, and plotting to make
her ruin her own joy out of fear and curiosity.]</p>
<p>"What are we to say, sister, [said one to the other] of the
monstrous lies of that silly creature? At one time her husband is a
young man, with the down just showing itself on his chin; at
another he is of middle age, and his hair begins to be silvered
with gray.... You may depend upon it, sister, either the wretch has
invented these lies to deceive us, or else she does not know
herself how her husband looks. Whichever is the case, she must be
deprived of these riches as soon as possible. And yet, if she is
really ignorant of her husband's appearance, she must no doubt have
married a god, and who knows what will happen? At all events,
if--which heaven forbid--she does become the mother of a divine
infant, I shall instantly hang myself. Meanwhile let us return to
our parents, and devise some scheme based on what we have just been
saying."</p>
<p>The sisters, thus inflamed with jealousy, called on their
parents in a careless and disdainful manner; and after being kept
awake all night by the turbulence of their spirits, made all haste
at morning to the rock, whence, by the wonted assistance of the
breeze, they descended swiftly to Psyche, and with tears squeezed
out by rubbing their eyelids, thus craftily addressed her:--</p>
<p>"Happy indeed are you, and fortunate in your very ignorance of
so heavy a misfortune. There you sit, without a thought of danger;
while we, your sisters, who watch over your interests with the most
vigilant care, are in anguish at your lost condition. For we have
learned as truth, and as sharers in your sorrows and misfortunes
cannot conceal it from you, that it is an enormous serpent, gliding
along in many folds and coils, with a neck swollen with deadly
venom, and prodigious gaping jaws, that secretly sleeps with you by
night. Remember the Pythian Oracle. Besides, a great many of the
husbandmen, who hunt all round the country, and ever so many of the
neighbors, have observed him returning home from his feeding-place
in the evening. All declare, too, that he will not long continue to
pamper you with delicacies, but will presently devour you. Will you
listen to us, who are so anxious for your precious safety, and
avoiding death, live with us secure from danger, or die horribly?
But if you are fascinated by your country home, or by the
endearments of a serpent, we have at all events done our duty
toward you, like affectionate sisters."</p>
<p>Poor, simple, tender-hearted Psyche was aghast with horror at
this dreadful story; and quite bereft of her senses, lost all
remembrance of her husband's admonitions and of her own promises,
and hurled herself headlong into the very abyss of calamity.
Trembling, therefore, with pale and livid cheeks and an almost
lifeless voice, she faltered out these broken words:--</p>
<p>"Dearest sisters, you have acted toward me as you ought, and
with your usual affectionate care; and indeed, it appears to me
that those who gave you this information have not invented a
falsehood. For, in fact, I have never yet beheld my husband's face,
nor do I know at all whence he comes. I only hear him speak in an
undertone by night, and have to bear with a husband of an unknown
appearance, and one that has an utter aversion to the light of day.
He may well, therefore, be some monster or other. Besides, he
threatens some shocking misfortune as the consequence of indulging
any curiosity to view his features. So, then, if you are able to
give any aid to your sister in this perilous emergency, don't delay
a moment."</p>
<p>[One of them replies:--]</p>
<p>"Since the ties of blood oblige us to disregard peril when your
safety is to be insured, we will tell you the only means of safety.
We have considered it over and over again. On that side of the bed
where you are used to lie, conceal a very sharp razor; and also
hide under the tapestry a lighted lamp, well trimmed and full of
oil. Make these preparations with the utmost secrecy. After the
monster has glided into bed as usual, when he is stretched out at
length, fast asleep and breathing heavily, as you slide out of bed,
go softly along with bare feet and on tiptoe, and bring out the
lamp from its hiding-place; then having the aid of its light, raise
your right hand, bring down the weapon with all your might, and cut
off the head of the creature at the neck. Then we will bring you
away with all these things, and if you wish, will wed you to a
human creature like yourself."</p>
<p>[They then depart, fearing for themselves if they are near when
the catastrophe happens.]</p>
<p>But Psyche, now left alone, except so far as a person who is
agitated by maddening Furies is not alone, fluctuated in sorrow
like a stormy sea; and though her purpose was fixed and her heart
was resolute when she first began to make preparations for the
impious work, her mind now wavered, and feared. She hurried, she
procrastinated; now she was bold, now tremulous; now dubious, now
agitated by rage; and what was the most singular thing of all, in
the same being she hated the beast and loved the husband.
Nevertheless, as the evening drew to a close, she hurriedly
prepared the instruments of her enterprise.</p>
<p>The night came, and with it her husband. After he fell asleep,
Psyche, to whose weak body and spirit the cruel influence of fate
imparted unusual strength, uncovered the lamp, and seized the knife
with the courage of a man. But the instant she advanced, she beheld
the very gentlest and sweetest of all creatures, even Cupid
himself, the beautiful God of Love, there fast asleep; at sight of
whom, the joyous flame of the lamp shone with redoubled vigor, and
the sacrilegious dagger repented the keenness of its edge.</p>
<p>But Psyche, losing the control of her senses, faint, deadly
pale, and trembling all over, fell on her knees, and made an
attempt to hide the blade in her own bosom; and this no doubt she
would have done had not the blade, dreading the commission of such
a crime, glided out of her rash hand. And now, faint and unnerved
as she was, she felt herself refreshed at heart by gazing upon the
beauty of those divine features. She looked upon the genial locks
of his golden head, teeming with ambrosial perfume, the circling
curls that strayed over his milk-white neck and roseate cheeks, and
fell gracefully entangled, some before and some behind, causing the
very light of the lamp itself to flicker by their radiant splendor.
On the shoulders of the god were dewy wings of brilliant whiteness;
and though the pinions were at rest, yet the tender down that
fringed the feathers wantoned to and fro in tremulous, unceasing
play. The rest of his body was smooth and beautiful, and such as
Venus could not have repented of giving birth to. At the foot of
his bed lay his bow, his quiver, and his arrows, the auspicious
weapons of the mighty god.</p>
<p>While with insatiable wonder and curiosity Psyche is examining
and admiring her husband's weapons, she draws one of the arrows out
of the quiver, and touches the point with the tip of her thumb to
try its sharpness; but happening to press too hard, for her hand
still trembled, she punctured the skin, so that some tiny drops of
rosy blood oozed forth. And thus did Psyche, without knowing it,
fall in love with Love. Then, burning more and more with desire for
Cupid, gazing passionately on his face, and fondly kissing him
again and again, her only fear was lest he should wake too
soon.</p>
<p>But while she hung over him, bewildered with delight so
overpowering, the lamp, whether from treachery or baneful envy, or
because it longed to touch, and to kiss as it were, so beautiful an
object, spirted a drop of scalding oil from the summit of its flame
upon the right shoulder of the god.... The god, thus scorched,
sprang from the bed, and seeing the disgraceful tokens of forfeited
fidelity, started to fly away, without a word, from the eyes and
arms of his most unhappy wife. But Psyche, the instant he arose,
seized hold of his right leg with both hands, and hung on to him, a
wretched appendage to his flight through the regions of the air,
till at last her strength failed her, and she fell to the
earth.</p>

<h2><a name="THOMAS_AQUINAS"></a>THOMAS AQUINAS</h2>
<h3>(1226-1274)</h3>
<h3>BY EDWIN A. PACE</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>homas Aquinas, philosopher and theologian, was born in 1226, at
or near Aquino, in Southern Italy. He received his early training
from the Benedictines of Monte Cassino. Tradition says he was a
taciturn and seemingly dull boy, derisively nicknamed by his
fellows "the dumb ox," but admired by his teachers. He subsequently
entered the University of Naples. While studying there he joined
the Dominican Order, and was sent later on to Cologne, where he
became a pupil of Albertus Magnus. In 1251 he went to Paris, took
his degrees in theology, and began his career as a teacher in the
University. His academic work there was continued, with slight
interruptions, till 1261. The eleven years which followed were
spent partly in Rome, where Thomas enjoyed the esteem of Urban IV.
and Clement IV., and partly in the cities of Northern Italy, which
he visited in the interest of his Order. During this period he
produced the greatest of his works, and won such repute as a
theologian that the leading universities made every effort to
secure him as a teacher. He was appointed to a professorship at
Naples, where he remained from 1272 until the early part of 1274.
Summoned by Gregory X. to take part in the Council of Lyons, he set
out on his journey northward, but was compelled by illness to stop
at Fossa Nuova. Here he died March 7th, 1274. He was canonized in
1323, and was proclaimed a doctor of the Church by Pius V. in
1567.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-147.png" width="40%" alt=

<b>THOMAS AQUINAS</b></p>
<p>These honors were merited by a remarkable combination of ability
and virtue. To an absolute purity of life, St. Thomas added an
earnest love of truth and of labor. Calm in the midst of
discussion, he was equally proof against the danger of brilliant
success. As the friend of popes and princes, he might have attained
the highest dignities; but these he steadfastly declined, devoting
himself, so far as his duty permitted, to scientific pursuits.
Judged by his writings, he was intense yet thoroughly objective,
firm in his own position but dispassionate in treating the opinions
of others. Conclusions reached by daring speculation and faultless
logic are stated simply, impersonally. Keen replies are given
without bitterness, and the boldest efforts of reason are united
with the submissiveness of faith.</p>
<p>His works fill twenty-five large quarto volumes of the Parma
edition. This is, so far, the most complete collection, though
various portions have been edited from time to time with the
commentaries of learned theologians like Cajetan and Sylvius.
Partial translations have also been made into several modern
languages; but as yet there is no complete English edition of St.
Thomas.</p>
<p>Turning to the Latin text, the student cannot but notice the
contrast between the easy diction of modern philosophical writers
and the rugged conciseness of the medi&aelig;val Schoolman. On the
other hand, disappointment awaits those who quit the pages of
Cicero for the less elegant Latinity of the Middle Ages. What can
be said in favor of scholastic "style" is that it expresses clearly
and tersely the subtle shades of thought which had developed
through thirteen centuries, and which often necessitated a
sacrifice of classic form. With the Schoolmen, as with modern
writers on scientific subjects, precision was the first requisite,
and terminology was of more consequence than literary beauty.</p>
<p>Similar standards must be kept in view when we pass judgment
upon the technique of St. Thomas. In his presentation we find
neither the eloquence nor the rhetoric of the Fathers. He quotes
them continually, and in some of his works adopts their division
into books and chapters. But his exposition is more compact,
consisting at times of clear-cut arguments in series without an
attempt at transition, at other times of sustained reasoning
processes in which no phrase is superfluous and no word ambiguous.
Elsewhere he uses the more rigid mold which was peculiar to the
Scholastic Period, and had been fashioned chiefly by Alexander
Hales. Each subject is divided into so many "questions," and each
question into so many "articles." The "article" begins with the
statement of objections, then discusses various opinions,
establishes the author's position, and closes with a solution of
the difficulties which that position may encounter. This method had
its advantages. It facilitated analysis, and obliged the writer to
examine every aspect of a problem. It secured breadth of view and
thoroughness of treatment. It was, especially, a transparent medium
for reason, unbiased by either sentiment or verbiage.</p>
<p>If such qualities of style and presentation were encouraged by
the environment in which Aquinas pursued his earlier studies, they
were also helpful in the task which he chose as his life-work. This
was the construction of a system in which all the elements of
knowledge should be harmoniously united. An undertaking so vast
necessitated a long preparation, the study of all available
sources, and the elucidation of many detailed problems. Hence, a
considerable portion of St. Thomas's works is taken up with the
explanation of Peter Lombard's 'Sententi&aelig;,' with Commentaries
on Aristotle, with Expositions of Sacred Scripture, collections
from the Fathers, and various <i>opuscula</i> or studies on special
subjects. Under the title 'Qu&aelig;stiones Disputat&aelig;,'
numerous problems in philosophy and theology are discussed at
length. But the synthetic power of Aquinas is shown chiefly in the
'Contra Gentes' and the 'Summa Theologica,' the former being a
defense of Christian belief with special reference to Arabian
philosophy, and the latter a masterly compendium of rational and
revealed truth.</p>
<p>The conception of the 'Summa' was not altogether original. From
the earliest days of the Church, men of genius had insisted on the
reasonableness of Christian belief by showing that, though
supernatural in its origin, it did not conflict with either the
facts or the laws of human knowledge. And as these had found their
highest expression in Greek philosophy, it was natural that this
philosophy should serve as a basis for the elucidation of revealed
truth. The early Fathers turned to Plato, not only because his
teaching was so spiritual, but also because it could be so readily
used as a framework for those theological concepts which
Christianity had brought into the world. Thus adopted by men who
were recognized authorities in the Church,--especially men like
Augustine and the Areopagite,--Platonism endured for centuries as
the rational element in dogmatic exposition.</p>
<p>Scholasticism inaugurated a new era. Patristic erudition had
gathered a wealth of theological knowledge which the Schoolmen
fully appreciated. But the same truths were to receive another
setting and be treated by different methods. Speculation changed
its direction, Aristotle taking the place of his master. The
peripatetic system found able exponents in the earlier Scholastics;
but Aquinas surpassed them alike in the mastery of the
philosopher's principles and in his application of these principles
to Christian doctrine. His Commentaries on Aristotle adhere
strictly to the text, dissecting its meaning and throwing into
relief the orderly sequence of ideas. In his other works, he
develops the germs of thought which he had gathered from the
Stagirite, and makes them the groundwork of his philosophical and
theological speculations.</p>
<p>With the subtlety of a metaphysician St. Thomas combined a vast
erudition. Quotations from the Fathers appear on nearly every page
of his writings, serving either as a keynote to the discussion
which follows, or as an occasion for solving objections. Toward St.
Augustine he shows the deepest reverence, though their methods
differ so widely, and his brief but lucid comments throw light on
difficult sayings of the great Doctor. His familiarity with
patristic theology is shown particularly in the 'Catena Aurea,'
where he links with passages from the Sacred Text numerous extracts
from the older commentators.</p>
<p>His respect for these interpretations did not prevent him from
making a thorough search of Scripture itself. With characteristic
clearness and depth he interpreted various books of the Bible,
insisting chiefly on the doctrinal meaning. The best of his work in
this line was devoted to the Pauline Epistles and to the Book of
Job; but his mastery of each text is no less evident where he takes
the authority of Scripture as the starting-point in theological
argument, or makes it the crowning evidence at the close of a
philosophical demonstration.</p>
<p>The materials gathered from Philosophy, Tradition, and Scripture
were the fruit of analysis; the final synthesis had yet to be
accomplished. This was the scope of the 'Summa Theologica,' a work
which, though it was not completed, is the greatest production of
Thomas Aquinas. In the prologue he says:--</p>
<blockquote>"Since the teacher of Catholic truth should instruct
not only those who are advanced, but also those who are beginning,
it is our purpose in this work to treat subjects pertaining to the
Christian religion in a manner adapted to the instruction of
beginners. For we have considered that young students encounter
various obstacles in the writings of different authors: partly
because of the multiplication of useless questions, articles, and
arguments; partly because the essentials of knowledge are dealt
with, not in scientific order, but according as the explanation of
books required or an occasion for disputing offered; partly because
the frequent repetition of the same things begets weariness and
confusion in the hearer's mind. Endeavoring, therefore, to avoid
these defects and others of a like nature, we shall try, with
confidence in the Divine assistance, to treat of sacred science
briefly and clearly, so far as the subject-matter will
allow."</blockquote>
<p>The work intended for novices in theology, and so
unpretentiously opened, is then portioned out in these words:--</p>
<blockquote>"Whereas, the chief aim of this science is to impart a
knowledge of God, not only as existing in Himself, but also as the
origin and end of all things, and especially of rational creatures,
we therefore shall treat first of God; second, of the rational
creature's tendency toward God; third, of Christ, who as man is the
way whereby we approach unto God. Concerning God, we shall consider
(1) those things which pertain to the Divine Essence; (2) those
which regard the distinction of persons; (3) those which concern
the origin of creatures from Him. As to the Divine Essence we shall
inquire (1) whether God exists; (2) what is, or rather what is not,
the manner of His existence; (3) how He acts through His knowledge,
will, and power. Under the first&cedil; heading we shall ask
whether God's existence is self-evident, whether it can be
demonstrated, and whether God does exist."</blockquote>
<p>Similar subdivisions precede each question as it comes up for
discussion, so that the student is enabled to take a comprehensive
view, and perceive the bearing of one problem on another as well as
its place in the wide domain of theology. As a consequence, those
who are familiar with the 'Summa' find in it an object-lesson of
breadth, proportion, and orderly thinking. Its chief merit,
however, lies in the fact that it is the most complete and
systematic exhibition of the harmony between reason and faith. In
it, more than in any other of his works, is displayed the mind of
its author. It determines his place in the history of thought, and
closes what may be called the second period in the development of
Christian theology. Scholasticism, the high point of intellectual
activity in the Church, reached its culmination in Thomas
Aquinas.</p>
<p>His works have been a rich source of information for Catholic
theologians, and his opinions have always commanded respect. The
polemics of the sixteenth century brought about a change in
theological methods, the positive and critical elements becoming
more prominent. Modern rationalism, however, has intensified the
discussion of those fundamental problems which St. Thomas handled
so thoroughly. As his writings furnish both a forcible statement of
the Catholic position and satisfactory replies to many current
objections, the Thomistic system has recently been restored. The
"neo-scholastic movement" was initiated by Leo XIII. in his
Encyclical '&AElig;terni Patris,' dated August 4th, 1879, and its
rapid growth has made Aquinas the model of Catholic thought in the
nineteenth century, as he certainly was in the thirteenth.</p>
<p>The subjoined extracts show his views on some questions of
actual importance, with regard not alone to medi&aelig;val
controversies, but to the problems of the universe, which will
press on the minds of men twenty-five hundred years in the future
as they did twenty-five hundred years in the past.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_VALUE_OF_OUR_CONCEPTS_OF_THE_DEITY"></a>ON THE
VALUE OF OUR CONCEPTS OF THE DEITY</h2>
<br>
<center>Part I--From the 'Summa Theologica'</center>
<br>
<p>It is obvious that terms implying negation or extrinsic relation
in no way signify the divine substance, but simply the removal of
some attribute from Him, or His relation with other beings, or
rather the relation of other beings with Him. As to appellations
that are absolute and positive,--such as <i>good, wise</i>, and the
like,--various opinions have been entertained. It was held by some
that these terms, though used affirmatively, were in reality
devised for the purpose of elimination, and not with the intent of
positive attribution. Hence, they claimed, when we say that God is
a living being, we mean that God's existence is not that of
inanimate things; and so on for other predicates. This was the
position of Rabbi Moses. According to another view these terms are
employed to denote a relation between God and creatures; so that
for instance, when we say, God is good, we mean, God is the cause
of goodness in all things.</p>
<p>Both interpretations, however, are open to a threefold
objection. For, in the first place, neither can offer any
explanation of the fact that certain terms are applied to the Deity
in preference to others. As He is the source of all good, so He is
the cause of all things corporeal; consequently, if by affirming
that God is good we merely imply that He is the cause of goodness,
we might with equal reason assert that He is a corporeal being.</p>
<p>Again, the inference from these positions would be that all
terms applied to God have only a secondary import, such, for
instance, as we give to the word <i>healthy</i>, as applied to
medicine; whereby we signify that it is productive of health in the
organism, while the organism itself is said, properly and
primarily, to be healthy.</p>
<p>In the third place, these interpretations distort the meaning of
those who employ such terms in regard to the Deity. For, when they
declare that He is the living God, they certainly mean something
else than that He is the cause of our life or that He is different
from inanimate bodies.</p>
<p>We are obliged, therefore, to take another view, and to affirm
that such terms denote the substantial nature of God, but that, at
the same time, their representative force is deficient. They
express the knowledge which our intellect has of God; and since
this knowledge is gotten from created things, we know Him according
to the measure in which creatures represent Him. Now God,
absolutely and in all respects perfect, possesses every perfection
that is found in His creatures. Each created thing, therefore,
inasmuch as it has some perfection, resembles and manifests the
Deity; not as a being of the same species or genus with itself, but
as a supereminent source from which are derived its effects. They
represent Him, in a word, just as the energy of the terrestrial
elements represents the energy of the sun.</p>
<p>Our manner of speech, therefore, denotes the substance of God,
yet denotes it imperfectly, because creatures are imperfect
manifestations of Him. When we say that God is good, we do not mean
that He is the cause of goodness or that He is not evil. Our
meaning is this: What we call goodness in creatures preexists in
God in a far higher way. Whence it follows, not that God is good
because He is the source of good, but rather, because He is good,
He imparts goodness to all things else; as St. Augustine says,
"Inasmuch as He is good, <i>we are</i>."</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="HOW_CAN_THE_ABSOLUTE_BE_A_CAUSE?"></a>HOW CAN THE
ABSOLUTE BE A CAUSE?</h2>
<center>From the 'Qu&aelig;stiones Disputat&aelig;'</center>
<br>
<p>The relations which are spoken of as existing between God and
creatures are not really in Him. A real relation is that which
exists between two things. It is mutual or bilateral then, only
when its basis in both correlates is the same. Such is the case in
all quantitive relations. Quantity being essentially the same in
all quanta, gives rise to relations which are real in both
terms--in the part, for instance, and in the whole, in the unit of
measurement and in that which is measured.</p>
<p>But where a relation originates in causation, as between that
which is active and that which is passive, it does not always
concern both terms. True, that which is acted upon, or set in
motion, or produced, must be related to the source of these
modifications, since every effect is dependent upon its cause. And
it is equally true that such causes or agencies are in some cases
related to their effects, namely, when the production of those
effects redounds in some way to the well-being of the cause itself.
This is evidently what happens when like begets like, and thereby
perpetuates, so far as may be, its own species.... There are cases,
nevertheless, in which a thing, without being related, has other
things related to it. The cognizing subject is related to that
which is the object of cognition--to a thing which is outside the
mind. But the thing itself is in no way affected by this cognition,
since the mental process is confined to the mind, and therefore
does not bring about any change in the object. Hence the relation
established by the act of knowing cannot be in that which is
known.</p>
<p>The same holds good of sensation. For though the physical object
sets up changes in the sense-organ, and is related to it as other
physical agencies are related to the things on which they act,
still, the sensation implies, over and above the organic change, a
subjective activity of which the external activity is altogether
devoid. Likewise, we say that a man is at the right of a pillar
because, with his power of locomotion, he can take his stand at the
right or the left, before or behind, above or below. But obviously
these relations, vary them as we will, imply nothing in the
stationary pillar, though they are real in the man who holds or
changes his position. Once more, a coin has nothing to do with the
action that gives it its value, since this action is a human
convention; and a man is quite apart from the process which
produces his image. Between a man and his portrait there is a
relation, but this is real in the portrait only. Between the coin
and its current value there is a relation, but this is not real in
the coin.</p>
<p>Now for the application. God's action is not to be understood as
going out from Him and terminating in that which He creates. His
action is Himself; consequently altogether apart from the genus of
created being whereby the creature is related to Him. And again, he
gains nothing by creating, or, as Avicenna puts it, His creative
action is in the highest degree generous. It is also manifest that
His action involves no modification of His being--without changing,
He causes the changeable. Consequently, though creatures are
related to Him, as effects to their cause, He is not really related
to them.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_PRODUCTION_OF_LIVING_THINGS"></a>ON THE
PRODUCTION OF LIVING THINGS</h2>
<center>From the 'Qu&aelig;stiones Disputat&aelig;'</center>
<br>
<p>According to Augustine, the passage "Let the earth bring forth
the green herb" means, not that plants were then actually produced
in their proper nature, but that a germinative power was given the
earth to produce plants by the work of propagation; so that the
earth is then said to have brought forth the green herb and the
fruit-yielding tree, inasmuch as it received the power of producing
them. This position is strengthened by the authority of Scripture
(Gen. ii. 4):--"These are the generations of the heaven and the
earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made
the heaven and the earth, and every plant in the field before it
sprang up in the earth, and every herb in the ground before it
grew." From this text we infer, first, that all the works of the
six days were created in the day that God made heaven and earth and
every plant of the field; and consequently that all plants, which
are said to have been created on the third day, were produced at
the same time that God created heaven and earth. The second
inference is that plants were then produced not actually, but only
according to causal virtues, in that the power to produce them was
given to the earth. And this is meant when it is said that He
produced every plant of the field before it actually arose upon the
earth by His dispositive action, and every herb of the earth before
it actually grew. Hence, before they came forth in reality, they
were made causally in the earth.</p>
<p>This view, moreover, is supported by reason. For in those first
days God made the creature either in its cause, or in its origin,
or in its actuality, by the work from which He afterward rested; He
nevertheless works even till now in the administration of things
created by the work of propagation. To this latter process belongs
the actual production of plants from the earth, because all that is
needed to bring them forth is the energy of the heavenly bodies as
their father, so to say, and the power of the earth in place of a
mother. Plants, therefore, were produced on the third day, not
actually, but causally. After the six days, however, they were
actually brought forth, according to their proper species and in
their proper nature, by the work of administration.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ARABIAN_NIGHTS"></a>THE ARABIAN NIGHTS</h2>
<h3>BY RICHARD GOTTHEIL</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he Arabian Nights--or, more accurately, 'The Thousand Nights and
a Night' (Alf Leilah wa-le&iacute;lah)--have gained a popularity in
Europe, since they were first turned into a modern language by
Galland in 1704, which rivals, if it does not exceed, their regard
in the East. They opened up to Europe a wealth of anecdote, a
fertility of daring fancy, which has not ceased to amuse and to
interest. It is not their value as literature which has placed them
so high in the popular esteem, both in the East and in the West;
for they are written in a style not a little slovenly, the same
scenes, figures, and expressions are repeated to monotony, and the
poetical extracts which are interwoven are often of very uncertain
excellence. Some of the modern translations--as by Payne and
Burton--have improved upon the original, and have often given it a
literary flavor which it certainly has not in the Arabic. For this
reason, native historians and writers seldom range the stories in
their literary chronicles, or even deign to mention them by name.
The 'Nights' have become popular from the very fact that they
affect little; that they are <i>contes</i> pure and simple,
picturing the men and the manners of a certain time without any
attempt to gloss over their faults or to excuse their foibles: so
that "the doings of the ancients become a lesson to those that
follow after, that men look upon the admonitory events that have
happened to others and take warning." All classes of men are to be
found there: Harun al-Rashid and his viziers, as well as the baker,
the cobbler, the merchant, the courtesan. The very coarseness is a
part of the picture; though it strikes us more forcibly than it did
those to whom the tales were told and for whom they were written
down. It is a kaleidoscope of the errors and failings and virtues
of the men whose daily life it records; it is also a picture of the
wonderfully rich fantasy of the Oriental mind.</p>

<br>
<p>In the better texts (<i>i.e.</i>, of Boulak and Calcutta) there
are no less than about two hundred and fifty stories; some long,
others short. There is no direct order in which they follow one
upon the other. The chief story may at any moment suggest a
subordinate one; and as the work proceeds, the looseness and
disconnectedness of the parts increase. The whole is held together
by a "frame"; a device which has passed into the epic of Ariosto
('Orlando Furioso,' xxviii.), and which is not unlike that used by
Boccaccio ('Decameron') and Chaucer ('Canterbury Tales'). This
"frame" is, in short:--A certain king of India, Shahriyar, aroused
by his wife's infidelity, determines to make an end of all the
women in his kingdom. As often as he takes a wife, on the morrow he
orders her slain. Shahrzad, the daughter of his Vizier, takes upon
herself the task of ridding the king of his evil intent. On the
night of her marriage to the king, she, together with her sister
Dunyazad, so engrosses his mind with her stories that the king
seeks their continuance night after night; thus she wards off her
fate for nearly three years. At the end of that time she has borne
the king three male children; and has, by the sprightliness of her
mind, gradually drawn all the conceit out of him, so that his land
is at rest. The tales told within this frame may be divided into:
(<i>a</i>) Histories, or long romances, which are often founded
upon historical facts; (<i>b</i>) Anecdotes and short stories,
which deal largely with the caliphs of the house of Abbas;
(<i>c</i>) Romantic fiction, which, though freely mingled with
supernatural intervention, may also be purely fictitious (<i>contes
fantastiques</i>); (<i>d</i>) Fables and Apologues; (<i>e</i>)
Tales, which serve the teller as the peg upon which to hang and to
exhibit his varied learning. In addition to this "frame," there is
a thread running through the whole; for the grand theme which is
played with so many variations is the picturing of love--in the
palace and in the hovel, in the city and in the desert. The scenes
are laid in all the four corners of the globe, but especially in
the two great centres of Muhammadan activity, Bagdad and Cairo. It
is not a matter of chance that Harun al-Rashid is the Caliph to
whom the legends of the 'Nights' have given a crown so very
different from the one which he really wore. Though his character
was often far from that which is pictured here, he was still a
patron of art and of literature. His time was the heyday of
Muhammadan splendor; and his city was the metropolis to which the
merchants and the scholars flocked from the length and breadth of
Arab dominion.</p>
<p>To unravel the literary history of such a collection is
difficult indeed, for it has drawn upon all civilizations and all
literatures. But since Hammer-Purgstall and De Sacy began to unwind
the skein, many additional turns have been given. The idea of the
"frame" in general comes undoubtedly from India; and such stories
as 'The Barber's Fifth Brother,' 'The Prince and the Afrit's
Mistress,' have been "traced back to the Hitopadesa, Panchatantra,
and Katha Sarit Sagara." The 'Story of the King, his Seven Viziers,
his Son, and his Favorite,' is but a late version, through the
Pahlavi, of the Indian Sindibad Romance of the time of Alexander
the Great. A number of fables are easily paralleled by those in the
famous collection of Bidpai (see the list in Jacobs's 'The Fables
of Bidpai,' London, 1888, lxviii.). This is probably true of the
whole little collection of beast fables in the One Hundred and
Forty-sixth Night; for such fables are based upon the different
reincarnations of the Buddha and the doctrine of metempsychosis.
The story of Jali'ad and the Vizier Shammas is distinctly reported
to have been translated from the Persian into Arabic. Even Greek
sources have not been left untouched, if the picture of the
cannibal in the adventures of Sindbad the Sailor be really a reflex
of the story of Odysseus and Polyphemus. Arabic historians--such as
Tabari, Masudi, Kazwini, al-Ja&uacute;zi--and the Kitab al-Aghani,
have furnished innumerable anecdotes and tales; while such old
Arabic poets as Imr al-Kais, Alkamah, Nabhighah, etc., have
contributed occasional verses.</p>
<p>It is manifest that such a mass of tales and stories was not
composed at any one time, or in any one place. Many must have
floated around in drinking-rooms and in houses of revelry for a
long time before they were put into one collection. Even to this
day the story of Ali Baba is current among the Bedouins in Sinai.
Whenever the digest was first made, it is certain that stories were
added at a later time. This is evident from the divergences seen in
the different manuscripts, and by the additional stories collected
by Payne and Burton. But in their present form, everything points
to the final redaction of the 'Nights' in Egypt. Of all the cities
mentioned, Cairo is described the most minutely; the manners and
customs of the <i>person&aelig;</i> are those of Egyptian
society--say from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century. For this
we have the warrant of Mr. Lane, than whom no one is to be heard
upon this subject with greater respect. That such stories as these
were popular in Egypt seems to follow from the fact that the only
mention of them is found in Makrisi's 'Description of Cairo' (1400)
and in Abu al-Mahasin, another historian of Egypt (1470). The
collection cannot have been made later than 1548, the date placed
by a reader on the manuscript used by Galland. But that its date is
not much earlier is shown by various chance references. The mention
of coffee (discovered in the fourteenth century); of cannon (first
mentioned in Egypt in 1383); of the wearing of different-colored
garments by Muslims, Jews, and Christians (instituted in 1301 by
Muhammad ibn Kela&uuml;n); of the order of Carandaliyyah (which did
not exist until the thirteenth century); of Sultani peaches (the
city Sultaniyyah was founded in the middle of the thirteenth
century)--point to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as the
approximate date of the final composition of the 'Nights.' This is
supported by the mention of the office of the Sheikh al-Islam, an
office not created before the year 1453. Additions, such as the
'Story of Abu Ker and Abu Zer,' were made as late as the sixteenth
century; and tobacco, which is mentioned, was not introduced into
Europe until the year 1560. The thirteenth, fourteenth, and
fifteenth centuries are a period of the revival of letters in
Egypt, which might well have induced some Arab lover of folk-lore
to write down a complete copy of these tales. The Emperor
Salah-al-din (1169) is the last historical personage mentioned, and
there is absolutely no trace of Shiite heresy to be found in the
whole collection. This omission would be impossible had they been
gathered up at the time of the heretical Fatimide dynasty
(900-1171).</p>
<p>But it seems equally certain that the 'Nights' did not originate
altogether in the land of the Nile. The figure of Harun al-Rashid,
the many doings in the "City of Peace" (Bagdad), lead us
irresistibly over to the Eastern capital of the Muhammadan Empire.
The genii and Afrits and much of the gorgeous picturing remind one
of Persia, or at least of Persian influence. The Arabs were largely
indebted to Persia for literature of a kind like this; and we know
that during the ninth and tenth centuries many books were
translated from the Pahlavi and Syriac. Thus Ibn al-Mukaffah (760)
gave the Arabs the 'Kholanamah,' the 'Amirnamah' (Mirror of
Princes), 'Kalilah,' and 'Dimnan.' etc. The historian Masudi (943)
expressly refers the story of the 'Thousand and One Nights' to a
Persian original. "The first who composed such tales and made use
of them were the ancient Persians. The Arabs translated them, and
made others like them." He then continues ('Prairies d'Or,' ed. De
Meynard) and mentions the book 'Hezar Afsane,' which means "a
thousand tales," a book popularly called the 'Thousand and One
Nights,' and containing the story of the king and his vizier, and
of his daughter Shirazaad and her slave-girl Dinazad. Other books
of the same kind are the book of Simas, containing stories of
Indian kings and viziers, the book of Sindibad, etc. (See also
'Hanz&aelig; Ispahanensis Annalium,' ed. Gottwaldt, 1844, page 41.)
A similar statement is made by Abu Y&aacute;kub al-Nadim (987) in
the 'Fihrist' (ed. Fl&uuml;gel, page 304):--"This book, 'Hezar
Afsane,' is said to have been written by the Princess Homai (or
Homain), daughter of Bahman. It comprises a Thousand Nights, but
less than two hundred stories; for a night story often was related
in a number of nights. I have seen it many times complete; but it
is in truth a meagre and uninteresting publication." A translation
of the 'Hezar Afsane' was made into Arabic, and it is again
mentioned in the middle of the twelfth century by Abdulhec
al-H&aacute;zraji; but neither it nor the original Pahlavi has yet
been found. It thus remains a matter of speculation as to how much
of the 'Hezar Afsane' has found its way into the 'Nights.' It is
evident that to it they are indebted for the whole general idea,
for many of the principal names, and probably for the groundwork of
a great many of the stories. The change of the title from 'The
Thousand' to 'The Thousand and One' is due to the fact that the
Arabs often expressed "a large number" by this second cipher. But
the 'Nights' cannot be a translation from the Persian; for the
other two books mentioned by Masudi are in the Arabic collection.
Lane supposes the relationship to be that of the '&AElig;neid' to
the 'Odyssey.' But it is probably closer: one fifth of the
collection which, according to Payne, is common to all manuscripts,
will doubtless be found to be based on the Pahlavi original. That
the dependence is not greater is evident from the absence of the
great heroes of the Persian Epos--Feridun, Zer, Isfandyar, etc. The
heroes are all Arabs; the life depicted is wholly Arabic.</p>
<p>The original Persian 'Nights' must be quite old. Homai, the
Persian Semiramis, is mentioned in the 'Avesta'; and in Firdausi
she is the daughter and the wife of Artaxerxes Longimanus (B.C.
465-425). Her mother was a Jewess, Shahrazaad, one of the captives
brought from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar; she afterward delivered
her nation from captivity. Tabari calls Esther, of Old Testament
fame, the mother of Bahman; and Professor de Goeje (de Gids, 1886,
iii. 385) has cleverly identified the Homai of the old 'Nights,'
not only with Shahrazaad of the Arabian, but also with Esther of
the Bible. That his argument holds good is seen from its acceptance
by Kuenen ('Hist. Krit. Einleitung,' 1, 2, page 222), August
M&uuml;ller (Deutsche Rundschau, 1887), and Darmesteter ('Actes du
Huiti&egrave;me Congr&egrave;s des Orientalistes,' 1893, ii.
196).</p>
<p>The best translations of the 'Nights' have been made by Antoine
Galland in French (12 vols., Paris, 1704-1712); by G. Weil in
German (4 vols., 1838-1842); and in English by E.W. Lane (3 vols.,
1839-1841), John Payne (13 vols., 1882-1884), and Richard Burton
(16 vols., 1885-1888). Lane's and Burton's translations are
enriched by copious notes of great value.</p>

STORY OF THE CITY OF BRASS'</h2>
<center>Part of Nights 566 and 578: Translation of E.W.
Lane</center>
<br>
<p>There was in olden time, and in an ancient age and period, in
Damascus of Syria, a King, one of the Khaleefehs, named
Abd-El-Melik, the son of Marw&aacute;n; and he was sitting, one
day, having with him the great men of his empire, consisting of
Kings and Sultans, when a discussion took place among them
respecting the traditions of former nations. They called to mind
the stories of our lord Suleym&aacute;n the son of Daood (on both
of whom be peace!) and the dominion and authority which God (whose
name be exalted!) had bestowed upon him, over mankind and the Jinn
and the birds and the wild beasts and other things; and they said,
We have heard from those who were before us, that God (whose
perfection be extolled, and whose name be exalted!) bestowed not
upon any one the like of that which He bestowed upon our lord
Suleym&aacute;n, and that he attained to that to which none other
attained, so that he used to imprison the Jinn and the
M&aacute;rids and the Devils in bottles of brass, and pour molten
lead over them, and seal this cover over them with his
signet....</p>
<p>And the Prince of the Faithful, Abd-El-Melik, the son of
Marw&aacute;n, wondered at these words, and said, Extolled be the
perfection of God! Suleym&aacute;n was endowed with a mighty
dominion!--And among those who were present in that assembly was
En-F&aacute;bighah Edh-Dhuby&aacute;nee; and he said, T&aacute;lib
hath spoken truth in that which he hath related, and the proof of
his veracity is the saying of the Wise, the First [thus
versified]:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>And [consider] Suleym&aacute;n, when the Deity said to him,
Perform</p>
<p class="i1">the office of Khaleefeh, and govern with
diligence;</p>
<p>And whoso obeyeth thee, honor him for doing so; and whoso</p>
<p class="i1">disobeyeth thee, imprison him forever.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He used to put them into bottles of brass, and to cast them into
the sea.</p>
<p>And the Prince of the Faithful approved of these words, and
said, By Allah, I desire to see some of these bottles! So
T&aacute;lib the son of Sahl replied, O Prince of the Faithful,
thou art able to do so and yet remain in thy country. Send to thy
brother Abd-El-Azeez, the son of Marw&aacute;n, desiring him to
bring them to thee from the Western Country, that he may write
orders to Moos&agrave; to journey from the Western Country, to this
mountain which we have mentioned, and to bring thee what thou
desirest of these bottles; for the furthest tract of his province
is adjacent to this mountain.--And the Prince of the Faithful
approved of his advice, and said, O T&aacute;lib, thou has spoken
truth in that which thou hast said, and I desire that thou be my
messenger to Moos&agrave; the son of Nuseyr for this purpose, and
thou shalt have a white ensign, together with what thou shalt
desire of wealth or dignity or other things, and I will be thy
substitute to take care of thy family. To this T&aacute;lib
replied, Most willingly, O Prince of the Faithful. And the
Khaleefeh said to him, Go, in dependence on the blessing of God,
and his aid....</p>
<p>So T&aacute;lib went forth on his way to Egypt ... and to Upper
Egypt, until they came to the Emeer Moos&agrave;, the son of
Nuseyr; and when he knew of his approach he went forth to him and
met him, and rejoiced at his arrival; and T&aacute;lib handed to
him the letter. So he took it and read it, and understood its
meaning; and he put it upon his head, saying, I hear and obey the
command of the Prince of the Faithful. He determined to summon his
great men; and they presented themselves; and he inquired of them
respecting that which had been made known to him by the letter;
whereupon they said, O Emeer, if thou desire him who will guide
thee to that place, have recourse to the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad, the
son of Abd-El-Kuddoos Es-Sa-moodee; for he is a knowing man, and
hath traveled much, and he is acquainted with the deserts and
wastes and the seas, and their inhabitants and their wonders, and
the countries of their districts. Have recourse, therefore, to him,
and he will direct thee to the object of thy desire.--Accordingly
he gave orders to bring him, and he came before him; and lo, he was
a very old man, whom the vicissitudes of years and times had
rendered decrepit. The Emeer Moos&agrave; saluted him, and said to
him, O sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad, our lord the Prince of the Faithful,
Abd-El-Melik the son of Marw&aacute;n, hath commanded us thus and
thus, and I possess little knowledge of that land, and it hath been
told me that thou art acquainted with that country and the routes.
Hast thou then a wish to accomplish the affair of the Prince of the
Faithful?--The sheykh replied, Know, O Emeer, that this route is
difficult, far extending, with few tracks. The Emeer said to him,
How long a period doth it require? He answered, It is a journey of
two years and some months going, and the like returning; and on the
way are difficulties and horrors, and extraordinary and wonderful
things. Moreover, thou art a warrior for the defense of the faith,
and our country is near unto the enemy; so perhaps the Christians
may come forth during our absence; it is expedient, therefore, that
thou leave in thy province one to govern it.--He replied, Well. And
he left his son H&aacute;roon as his substitute in his province,
exacted an oath of fidelity to him, and commanded the troops that
they should not oppose him, but obey him in all that he should
order them to do. And they heard his words, and obeyed him. His son
H&aacute;roon was of great courage, an illustrious hero, and a bold
champion; and the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad pretended to him that the
place in which were the things that the Prince of the Faithful
desired was four months' journey distant, on the shore of the sea,
and that throughout the whole route were halting-places, adjacent
one to another, and grass and springs. And he said, God will
assuredly make this affair easy to us through the blessing
attendant upon thee, O Viceroy of the Prince of the Faithful. Then
the Emeer Moos&agrave; said, Knowest thou if any one of the Kings
have trodden this land before us? He answered him, Yes, O Emeer:
this land belonged to the King of Alexandria, Darius the Greek.</p>
<p>[The cavalcade fare on, and soon reach a first "extraordinary
and wonderful thing,"--the palace-tomb of great "Koosh, the son of
Sheddad," full of impressive mortuary inscriptions that set the
party all a-weeping. Thence--]</p>
<p>The soldiers proceeded, with the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad before
them showing them the way, until all the first day had passed, and
the second, and the third. They then came to a high hill, at which
they looked, and lo, upon it was a horseman of brass, on the top of
whose spear was a wide and glistening head that almost deprived the
beholder of sight, and on it was inscribed, O thou who comest unto
me, if thou know not the way that leadeth to the City of Brass, rub
the hand of the horseman, and he will turn, and then will stop, and
in whatsoever direction he stoppeth, thither proceed, without fear
and without difficulty; for it will lead thee to the City of
Brass.--And when the Emeer Moos&agrave; had rubbed the hand of the
horseman, it turned like the blinding lightning, and faced a
different direction from that in which they were traveling.</p>
<p>The party therefore turned thither and journeyed on, and it was
the right way. They took that route, and continued their course the
same day and the next night until they had traversed a wide tract
of country. And as they were proceeding, one day, they came to a
pillar of black stone, wherein was a person sunk to his arm-pits,
and he had two huge wings, and four arms; two of them like those of
the sons of Adam, and two like the forelegs of lions, with claws.
He had hair upon his head like the tails of horses, and two eyes
like two burning coals, and he had a third eye, in his forehead,
like the eye of the lynx, from which there appeared sparks of fire.
He was black and tall; and he was crying out, Extolled be the
perfection of my Lord, who hath appointed me this severe affliction
and painful torture until the day of resurrection! When the party
beheld him, their reason fled from them, and they were stupefied at
the sight of his form, and retreated in flight; and the Emeer
Moos&agrave; said to the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad, What is this? He
answered, I know not what he is. And the Emeer said, Draw near to
him, and investigate his case: perhaps he will discover it, and
perhaps thou wilt learn his history. The sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad
replied, May God amend the state of the Emeer! Verily we fear
him.--Fear ye not, rejoined the Emeer; for he is withheld from
injuring you and others by the state in which he is. So the sheykh
'Abd-Es-Samad drew near to him, and said to him, O thou person,
what is thy name, and what is thy nature, and what hath placed thee
here in this manner? And he answered him, As to me, I am an 'Efreet
of the Jinn, and my name is D&aacute;hish the son of El-Amash, and
I am restrained here by the majesty, confined by the power, [of
God,] tormented as long as God (to whom be ascribed might and
glory!) willeth. Then the Emeer Moos&agrave; said, O sheykh
'Abd-Es-Samad, ask him what is the cause of his confinement in this
pillar. He therefore asked respecting that, and the 'Efreet
answered him, Verily my story is wonderful, and it is this:</p>
<p>[The Evil Spirit narrates to them his history, being part of the
famous war between Solomon and the Jinn.]</p>
<p>The party therefore wondered at him, and at the horrible nature
of his form; and the Emeer Moos&agrave; said, There is no deity but
God! Suleym&aacute;n was endowed with a mighty dominion!--And the
sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad said to the 'Efreet, O thou, I ask thee
concerning a thing of which do thou inform us. The 'Efreet replied,
Ask concerning what thou wilt. And the sheykh said, Are there in
this place any of the 'Efreets confined in bottles of brass from
the time of Suleym&aacute;n, on whom be peace? He answered, Yes, in
the Sea of El-Karkar, where are a people of the descendants of Nooh
(on whom be peace!), whose country the deluge reached not, and they
are separated there from [the rest of] the sons of Adam.--And
where, said the sheykh, is the way to the City of Brass, and the
place wherein are the bottles? What distance is there between us
and it? The 'Efreet answered, It is near. So the party left him and
proceeded; and there appeared to them a great black object, with
two [seeming] fires corresponding with each other in position, in
the distance, in that black object; whereupon the Emeer
Moos&agrave; said to the sheykh, What is this great black object,
and what are these two corresponding fires? The guide answered him,
Be rejoiced, O Emeer; for this is the City of Brass, and this is
the appearance of it that I find described in the Book of Hidden
Treasures; that its wall is of black stones, and it hath two towers
of brass of El-Andalus, which the beholder seeth resembling two
corresponding fires; and thence it is named the City of Brass. They
ceased not to proceed until they arrived at it; and lo, it was
lofty, strongly fortified, rising high into the air, impenetrable:
the height of its walls was eighty cubits, and it had five and
twenty gates, none of which would open but by means of some
artifice; and there was not one gate to it that had not, within the
city, one like it: such was the beauty of the construction and
architecture of the city. They stopped before it, and endeavored to
discover one of its gates; but they could not; and the Emeer
Moos&agrave; said to the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad, O sheykh, I see not
to this city any gate. The sheykh replied, O Emeer, thus do I find
it described in the Book of Hidden Treasures; that it hath five and
twenty gates, and that none of its gates may be opened but from
within the city. And how, said the Emeer, can we contrive to enter
it, and divert ourselves with a view of its wonders?</p>
<p>Then the Emeer Moos&agrave; ordered one of his young men to
mount a camel, and ride round the city, in the hope that he might
discover a trace of a gate, or a place lower than that to which
they were opposite. So one of his young men mounted, and proceeded
around it for two days with their nights, prosecuting his journey
with diligence, and not resting; and when the third day arrived, he
came in sight of his companions, and he was astounded at that which
he beheld of the extent of the city, and its height. Then he said,
O Emeer, the easiest place in it is this place at which ye have
alighted. And thereupon the Emeer Moos&agrave; took T&aacute;lib
the son of Sahl, and the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad, and they ascended a
mountain opposite the city, and overlooking it; and when they had
ascended that mountain, they saw a city than which eyes had not
beheld any greater. Its pavilions were lofty, and its domes were
shining; its mansions were in good condition, and its rivers were
running; its trees were fruitful, and its gardens bore ripe
produce. It was a city with impenetrable gates, empty, still,
without a voice or a cheering inhabitant, but the owl hooting in
its quarters, and birds skimming in circles in its areas, and the
raven croaking in its districts and its great thoroughfare-streets,
and bewailing those who had been in it. The Emeer Moos&agrave;
paused, sorrowing for its being devoid of inhabitants, and its
being despoiled of people and dwellers; and he said, Extolled be
the perfection of Him whom ages and times change not, the Creator
of the creation by his power! And while he was extolling the
perfection of God, (to whom be ascribed might and glory!) he
happened to look aside, and lo, there were seven tablets of white
marble, appearing from a distance. So he approached them, and
behold, they were sculptured and inscribed; and he ordered that
their writing should be read: therefore the sheykh Abd-Es-Samad
advanced and examined them and read them; and they contained
admonition, and matter for example and restraint, unto those
endowed with faculties of discernment. Upon the first tablet was
inscribed, in the ancient Greek character,--</p>
<p>O son of Adam, how heedless art thou of the case of him who hath
been before thee! Thy years and age have diverted thee from
considering him. Knowest thou not that the cup of death will be
filled for thee, and that in a short time thou wilt drink it? Look
then to thyself before entering thy grave. Where are those who
possessed the countries and abased the servants of God and led
armies? Death hath come upon them; and God is the terminator of
delights and the separator of companions and the devastator of
flourishing dwellings; so He hath transported them from the
amplitude of palaces to the straightness of the graves.</p>
<p>And in the lower part of the tablet were inscribed these
verses:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Where are the Kings and the peoplers of the earth? They have</p>
<p class="i1">quitted that which they have built and peopled;</p>
<p>And in the grave they are pledged for their past actions:
there</p>
<p class="i1">after destruction, they have become putrid
corpses.</p>
<p>Where are the troops? They repelled not, nor profited. And</p>
<p class="i1">where is that which they collected and hoarded?</p>
<p>The decree of the Lord of the Throne surprised them. Neither</p>
<p>riches nor refuge saved them from it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And the Emeer Moos&agrave; fainted; his tears ran down upon his
cheeks, and he said, By Allah, indifference to the world is the
most appropriate and the most sure course! Then he caused an
inkhorn and a paper to be brought, and he wrote the inscription of
the first tablet; after which he drew near to the second tablet,
and the third, and the fourth; and having copied what was inscribed
on them, he descended from the mountain; and the world had been
pictured before his eyes.</p>
<p>And when he came back to the troops, they passed the day
devising means of entering the city; and the Emeer Moos&agrave;
said to his Wezeer, T&aacute;lib the son of Sahl, and to those of
his chief officers who were around him, How shall we contrive to
enter the city, that we may see its wonders? Perhaps we shall find
in it something by which we may ingratiate ourselves with the
Prince of the Faithful.--T&aacute;lib the son of Sahl replied, May
God continue the prosperity of the Emeer! Let us make a ladder, and
mount upon it, and perhaps we shall gain access to the gate from
within.--And the Emeer said, This is what occurred to my mind, and
excellent is the advice. Then he called to the carpenters and
blacksmiths, and ordered them to make straight some pieces of wood,
and to construct a ladder covered with plates of iron. And they did
so, and made it strong. They employed themselves in constructing it
a whole month, and many men were occupied in making it. And they
set it up and fixed it against the wall, and it proved to be equal
to the wall in height, as though it had been made for it before
that day. So the Emeer Moos&agrave; wondered at it, and said, God
bless you! It seemeth, from the excellence of your work, as though
ye had adapted it by measurement to the wall.--He then said to the
people, Which of you will ascend this ladder, and mount upon the
wall, and walk along it, and contrive means of descending into the
city, that he may see how the case is, and then inform us of the
mode of opening the gate? And one of them answered, I will ascend
it, O Emeer, and descend and open the gate. The Emeer therefore
replied, Mount. God bless thee!--Accordingly, the man ascended the
ladder until he reached the top of it; when he stood, and fixed his
eyes towards the city, clapped his hands, and cried out with his
loudest voice, saying, Thou art beautiful! Then he cast himself
down into the city, and his flesh became mashed with his bones. So
the Emeer Moos&agrave; said, This is the action of the rational.
How then will the insane act? If we do thus with all our
companions, there will not remain of them one; and we shall be
unable to accomplish our affair, and the affair of the Prince of
the Faithful. Depart ye; for we have no concern with this
city.--But one of them said, Perhaps another than this may be more
steady than he. And a second ascended, and a third, and a fourth,
and a fifth; and they ceased not to ascend by that ladder to the
top of the wall, one after another, until twelve men of them had
gone, acting as acted the first. Therefore the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad
said, There is none for this affair but myself, and the experienced
is not like the inexperienced. But the Emeer Moos&agrave; said to
him, Thou shalt not do that, nor will I allow thee to ascend to the
top of this wall; for shouldst thou die, thou wouldst be the cause
of the death of us all, and there would not remain of us one; since
thou art the guide of the party. The sheykh however replied,
Perhaps the object will be accomplished by my means, through the
will of God, whose name be exalted! And thereupon all the people
agreed to his ascending.</p>
<p>Then the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad arose, and encouraged himself, and
having said, In the name of God, the Compassionate, the
Merciful!--he ascended the ladder, repeating the praises of God
(whose name be exalted!) and reciting the Verses of Safety, until
he reached the top of the wall; when he clapped his hands, and
fixed his eyes. The people therefore all called out to him, and
said, O sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad, do it not, and cast not thyself down!
And they said, Verily to God we belong, and verily unto him we
return! If the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad fall, we all perish!--Then the
sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad laughed immoderately, and sat a long time
repeating the praises of God, (whose name be exalted!) and reciting
the Verses of Safety; after which he rose with energy, and called
out with his loudest voice, O Emeer, no harm shall befall you; for
God (to whom be ascribed might and glory!) hath averted from me the
effect of the artifice and fraudulence of the Devil, through the
blessing resulting from the utterance of the words, In the name of
God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.--So the Emeer said to him,
What hast thou seen, O sheykh? He answered, When I reached the top
of the wall, I beheld ten damsels, like moons, who made a sign with
their hands, as though they would say, Come to us. And it seemed to
me that beneath me was a sea (or great river) of water; whereupon I
desired to cast myself down, as our companions did: but I beheld
them dead; so I withheld myself from them, and recited some words
of the Book of God, (whose name be exalted!) whereupon God averted
from me the influence of those damsels' artifice, and they departed
from me; therefore I cast not myself down, and God repelled from me
the effect of their artifice and enchantment. There is no doubt
that this is an enchantment and an artifice which the people of
this city contrived in order to repel from it every one who should
desire to look down upon it, and wish to obtain access to it; and
these our companions are laid dead.</p>
<p>He then walked along the wall till he came to the two towers of
brass, when he saw that they had two gates of gold, without locks
upon them, or any sign of the means of opening them. Therefore the
sheykh paused as long as God willed, and looking attentively, he
saw in the middle of one of the gates a figure of a horseman of
brass, having one hand extended, as though he were pointing with
it, and on it was an inscription, which the sheykh read, and lo, it
contained these words:--Turn the pin that is in the middle of the
front of the horseman's body twelve times, and then the gate will
open. So he examined the horseman, and in the middle of the front
of his body was a pin, strong, firm, well fixed; and he turned it
twelve times; whereupon the gate opened immediately, with a noise
like thunder; and the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad entered. He was a
learned man, acquainted with all languages and characters. And he
walked on until he entered a long passage, whence he descended some
steps, and he found a place with handsome wooden benches, on which
were people dead, and over their heads were elegant shields, and
keen swords, and strung bows, and notched arrows. And behind the
[next] gate were a bar of iron, and barricades of wood, and locks
of delicate fabric, and strong apparatus. Upon this, the sheykh
said within himself, Perhaps the keys are with these people. Then
he looked, and lo, there was a sheykh who appeared to be the oldest
of them, and he was upon a high wooden bench among the dead men. So
the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad said, May not the keys of the city be with
this sheykh? Perhaps he was the gate-keeper of the city, and these
were under his authority. He therefore drew near to him, and lifted
up his garments, and lo, the keys were hung to his waist. At the
sight of them, the sheykh 'Abd-Es-Samad rejoiced exceedingly; his
reason almost fled from him in consequence of his joy: and he took
the keys, approached the gate, opened the locks, and pulled the
gate and the barricades and other apparatus which opened, and the
gate also opened, with a noise like thunder, by reason of its
greatness and terribleness, and the enormousness of its apparatus.
Upon this, the sheykh exclaimed, God is most great!--and the people
made the same exclamation with him, rejoicing at the event. The
Emeer Moos&agrave; also rejoiced at the safety of the sheykh
'Abd-Es-Samad, and at the opening of the gate of the city; the
people thanked the sheykh for that which he had done, and all the
troops hastened to enter the gate. But the Emeer Moos&agrave; cried
out to them, saying to them, O people, if all of us enter, we shall
not be secure from some accident that may happen. Half shall enter,
and half shall remain behind.</p>
<p>The Emeer Moos&agrave; then entered the gate, and with him half
of the people, who bore their weapons of war. And the party saw
their companions lying dead: so they buried them. They saw also the
gate-keepers and servants and chamberlains and lieutenants lying
upon beds of silk, all of them dead. And they entered the market of
the city, and beheld a great market, with lofty buildings, none of
which projected beyond another: the shops were open, and the scales
hung up, and the utensils of brass ranged in order, and the
kh&aacute;ns were full of all kinds of goods. And they saw the
merchants dead in their shops: their skins were dried, and their
bones were carious, and they had become examples to him who would
be admonished. They saw likewise four markets of particular shops
filled with wealth. And they left this place, and passed on to the
silk-market, in which were silks and brocades interwoven with red
gold and white silver upon various colours, and the owners were
dead, lying upon skins, and appearing almost as though they would
speak. Leaving these, they went on to the market of jewels and
pearls and jacinths; and they left it, and passed on to the market
of the money-changers, whom they found dead, with varieties of
silks beneath them, and their shops were filled with gold and
silver. These they left, and they proceeded to the market of the
perfumers; and lo, their shops were filled with varieties of
perfumes, and bags of musk, and ambergris, and aloes-wood, and
nedd, and camphor, and other things; and the owners were all dead,
not having with them any food. And when they went forth from the
market of the perfumers, they found near unto it a palace,
decorated, and strongly constructed; and they entered it, and found
banners unfurled, and drawn swords, and strung bows, and shields
hung up by chains of gold and silver, and helmets gilded with red
gold. And in the passages of that palace were benches of ivory,
ornamented with plates of brilliant gold, and with silk, on which
were men whose skins had dried upon the bones: the ignorant would
imagine them to be sleeping; but, from the want of food, they had
died, and tasted mortality. Upon this, the Emeer Moos&agrave;
paused, extolling the perfection of God (whose name be exalted!)
and his holiness, and contemplating the beauty of that palace.</p>
<p>[They find the palace a marvel of splendor, but as awfully
silent and mausoleum-like as the rest of the city; and soon reach a
magnificent hall in which lies the dead body of "Jedmur, the
Daughter of the King of the Amalekites," magnificently laid in
state, and magically preserved and protected. T&aacute;lib unwisely
and covetously attempts to rob the corpse of jewels; and is
instantly beheaded by its enchanted guards. The Emeer Moos&agrave;
and the sage 'Abd-Es-Samad, however, leave the place in safety,
return to Upper Egypt and Syria by way of the Country of the
Blacks, succeed in securing twelve of the wonderful bottles
containing Jinn,--and the tale concludes with the Emeer
Moos&agrave;'s resignation of his throne that he may die in
Jerusalem, so profoundly has he been affected by the
adventure.]</p>

<h2><a name="FROM_'THE_HISTORY_OF_KING_OMAR_BEN_ENNUMAN"></a>FROM
'THE HISTORY OF KING OMAR BEN ENNUMAN, AND<br>
HIS SONS SHERKAN AND ZOULMEKAN'</h2>
<center>Nights 15, 16, 17, and 18: Translation of Professor John
Payne</center>
<br>
<center>THE MEETING OF PRINCE SHERKAN AND PRINCESS ABRIZEH</center>
<br>
<p>There reigned once in the City of Peace [Bagdad], before the
Khalifate of Abdulmelik ben Merwan, a king called Omar ben Ennuman,
who was of the mighty giants, and had subdued the kings of Persia
and the emperors of the East, for none could warm himself at his
fire nor cope with him in battle; and when he was angry there came
sparks out of his nostrils. He had gotten him dominion over all
countries, and God had subjected unto him all creatures; his
commands were obeyed in all the great cities, and his armies
penetrated the most distant lands: the East and West came under his
rule, with the regions between them, Hind and Sind and China and
Hejaz and Yemen and the islands of India and China, Syria and
Mesopotamia and the lands of the blacks and the islands of the
ocean, and all the famous rivers of the earth, Jaxartes and Bactrus
and Nile and Euphrates. He sent his ambassadors to the farthest
parts of the earth to fetch him true report, and they returned with
tidings of justice and peace, bringing him assurance of loyalty and
obedience, and invocations of blessings on his head; for he was a
right noble king, and there came to him gifts and tribute from all
parts of the world. He had a son called Sherkan, who was one of the
prodigies of the age and the likest of all men to his father, who
loved him with an exceeding love and had appointed him to be king
after him. The prince grew up till he reached man's estate, and was
twenty years old, and God subjected all men to him, for he was
gifted with great might and prowess in battle, humbling the
champions and destroying all who made head against him. So, before
long, this Sherkan became famous in all quarters of the world, and
his father rejoiced in him; and his might waxed till he passed all
bounds, and magnified himself, taking by storm the citadels and
strong places.</p>
<p>[The Prince being sent to assist King Afridoun, of the Greeks,
against an enemy, is intrusted with an army of ten thousand
soldiers, and leaves Bagdad in military state.]</p>
<p>Then they loaded the beasts and beat the drums and blew the
clarions and unfurled the banners and the standards, whilst Sherkan
mounted, with the Vizier Dendan by his side, and the standards
waving over them; and the army set out and fared on with the
[Greek] ambassadors in the van till the day departed and the night
came, when they halted and encamped for the night. On the morrow,
as soon as God brought in the day, they took horse and continued
their march, nor did they cease to press onward, guided by the
ambassadors, for the space of twenty days. On the twenty-first day,
at nightfall, they came to a wide and fertile valley whose sides
were thickly wooded and covered with grass, and there Sherkan
called a three-days' halt. So they dismounted and pitched their
tents, dispersing right and left in the valley, whilst the Vizier
Dendan and the ambassadors alighted in the midst.</p>
<p>As for Sherkan, when he had seen the tents pitched and the
troops dispersed on either side, and had commanded his officers and
attendants to camp beside the Vizier Dendan, he gave reins to his
horse, being minded to explore the valley, and himself to mount
guard over the army, having regard to his father's injunctions and
to the fact that they had reached the frontier of the Land of Roum
and were now in the enemy's country. So he rode on alone, along the
valley, till a fourth part of the night was past, when he grew
weary and sleep overcame him so that he could no longer spur his
horse. Now he was used to sleep on horseback; so when drowsiness
got the better of him, he fell asleep, and the horse paced on with
him half the night and entered a forest: but Sherkan awoke not till
the steed smote the earth with his hoof. Then he started from sleep
and found himself among trees: and the moon arose and lighted the
two horizons. He was troubled at finding himself alone in this
place, and spoke the words which whoso says shall never be
confounded--that is to say, "There is no power and no virtue but in
GOD, the most High, the Supreme!" But as he rode on, in fear of the
wild beasts, behold the trees thinned out, and the moon shone out
upon a meadow as it were one of the meads of paradise, and he heard
therein the noise of talk and pleasant laughter, such as ravishes
the wit of men. So King Sherkan dismounted, and tying his horse to
a tree, fared on a little further, till he espied a stream of
running water, and heard a woman talking and saying in Arabic, "By
the virtue of the Messiah, this is not handsome of you! But whoso
speaks the word I will throw her down and bind her with her
girdle!" He followed in the direction of the voice, and saw
gazelles frisking and wild cattle pasturing, and birds in their
various voices expressing joy and gladness; and the earth was
embroidered with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as says
of it the poet, in the following verses:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Earth has no fairer sight to show than this its</p>
<p>blossom-time, With all the gently running streams</p>
<p class="i7">that wander o'er its face,</p>
<p>It is indeed the handiwork of God Omnipotent, The</p>
<p>Lord of every noble gift, and Giver of all grace!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Midmost the meadow stood a monastery, and within the inclosure a
citadel that rose high into the air in the light of the moon. The
stream passed through the midst of the monastery; and therenigh sat
ten damsels like moons, high-bosomed maids clad in dresses and
ornaments that dazzled the eyes, as says of them the poet:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The meadow glitters with the troops Of lovely ones</p>
<p class="i7">that wander there;</p>
<p>Its grace and beauty doubled are By these that are</p>
<p class="i7">so passing fair;</p>
<p>Virgins, that with their swimming gait, The hearts of</p>
<p class="i7">all that see ensnare,</p>
<p>Along whose necks, like trails of grapes, Stream down</p>
<p class="i7">the tresses of their hair;</p>
<p>Proudly they walk, with eyes that dart The shafts and</p>
<p class="i7">arrows of despair,</p>
<p>And all the champions of the world Are slain by</p>
<p class="i7">their seductive air.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sherkan looked at the ten girls, and saw in their midst a lady
like the moon at its full, with ringleted and shining forehead,
great black eyes and curling brow-locks, perfect in person and
attributes, as says the poet:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Her beauty beamed on me with glances wonder-bright: The</p>
<p class="i1">slender Syrian spears are not so straight and
slight:</p>
<p>She laid her veil aside, and, lo, her cheeks rose-red! All
manner</p>
<p class="i1">of loveliness was in their sweetest sight</p>
<p>The locks that o'er her brow fell down, were like the night,</p>
<p class="i1">From out of which there shines a morning of
delight.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then Sherkan heard her say to the girls, "Come on, that I may
wrestle with you, ere the moon set and the dawn come." So they came
up to her, one after another, and she overthrew them, one by one,
and bound their hands behind them, with their girdles. When she had
thrown them all, there turned to her an old woman who was before
her, and said, as if she were wroth with her, "O shameless! dost
thou glory in overthrowing these girls? Behold, I am an old woman,
yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of?
But if thou have strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may
grip thee, and put thy head between thy feet." The young lady
smiled at her words, although her heart was full of anger against
her, and said, "O my lady Dhat ed Dewahi, wilt indeed wrestle with
me--or dost thou jest with me?" "I mean to wrestle with thee in
very deed," replied she. "Stand up to me then," said the damsel,
"if thou have strength to do so!" When the old woman heard this she
was sore enraged, and her hair stood on end like that of a
hedgehog. Then she sprang up, whilst the damsel confronted her ...
and they took hold of one another, whilst Sherkan raised his eyes
to heaven and prayed to God that the damsel might conquer the old
hag. Presently ... the old woman strove to free herself, and in the
struggle wriggled out of the girl's hands and fell on her back ...
and behold the young lady ... throwing over her a veil of fine
silk, helped her to dress herself, making excuses to her and
saying, "O my lady Dhat ed Dewahi, I did not mean to throw thee so
roughly, but thou wriggledst out of my hands; so praised be God for
safety." She returned her no answer, but rose in her confusion and
walked away out of sight, leaving the young lady standing alone, by
the other girls thrown down and bound.</p>
<p>Then said Sherkan, "To every fortune there is a cause. Sleep
fell not on me, nor did the steed bear me hither but for my good
fortune; for of a surety this damsel and what is with her shall be
my prize." So he turned back and mounted, and drew his scimitar;
then he gave his horse the spur and he started off with him like an
arrow from a bow, whilst he brandished his naked blade and cried
out, "God is most great!" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her
feet, and running to the bank of the river, which was there six
cubits wide, made a spring and landed on the other side, where she
turned, and standing cried out in a loud voice, "Who art thou,
sirrah, that breakest in on our pasture as if thou wert charging an
army? Whence comest thou and whither art thou bound? Speak the
truth and it shall profit thee, and do not lie, for lying is of the
losel's fashion. Doubtless thou hast strayed this night from thy
road, that thou hast happened on this place. So tell me what thou
seekest: if thou wouldst have us set thee in the right road, we
will do so; or if thou seek help we will help thee."</p>
<p>When Sherkan heard her words he replied, "I am a stranger of the
Muslims, who am come out by myself in quest of booty, and I have
found no fairer purchase this moonlit night than these ten damsels;
so I will take them and rejoin my comrades with them." Quoth she,
"I would have thee to know that thou hast not yet come at the
booty; and as for these ten damsels, by Allah, they are no purchase
for thee! Indeed the fairest purchase thou canst look for is to win
free of this place: for thou art in a mead, where, if we gave one
cry, there would be with us anon four thousand knights. Did I not
tell thee that lying is shameful?" And he said, "The fortunate man
is he to whom God sufficeth, and who hath no need of other than
him." "By the virtue of the Messiah," replied she, "did I not fear
to have thy death at my hand, I would give a cry that would fill
the meadow on thee, with horse and foot! but I have pity on the
stranger; so, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou
dismount from thy horse, and swear to me by thy faith that thou
wilt not approach me with aught of arms, and we will wrestle--I and
thou. If thou throw me, lay me on thy horse and take all of us to
thy booty; and if I throw thee, thou shalt be at my commandment.
Swear this to me; for I fear thy perfidy, since experience has it
that as long as perfidy is in men's natures, to trust in every one
is weakness. But if thou wilt swear I will come over to thee."
Quoth Sherkan, "Impose on me whatever oath thou deemest binding,
and I will swear not to draw near thee until thou hast made thy
preparations, and sayest 'Come wrestle with me.' If thou throw me I
have wealth wherewith to ransom myself, and if I throw thee I shall
get fine purchase." Then said she, "Swear to me by Him who hath
lodged the soul in the body and given laws to mankind that thou
wilt not hurt me with aught of violence save in the way of
wrestling--else mayest thou die out of the pale of Islam." "By
Allah," exclaimed Sherkan, "if a Cadi should swear me, though he
were Cadi of the Cadis, he would not impose on me the like of this
oath!" Then he took the oath she required, and tied his horse to a
tree, sunken in the sea of reverie, and saying in himself, "Glory
to Him who fashioned her!" Then he girt himself, and made ready for
wrestling, and said to her, "Cross the stream to me." Quoth she,
"It is not for me to come to thee; if thou wilt, do thou cross over
to me." "I cannot do that," replied he; and she said, "O boy! I
will come to thee." So she gathered her skirts, and making a spring
landed on the other side of the river by him; whereupon he drew
near to her, wondering at her beauty and grace, and saw a form that
the hand of Omnipotence had turned with the leaves of Jinn, and
which had been fostered by divine solicitude, a form on which the
zephyrs of fair fortune had blown, and over whose creation
favorable planets had presided. Then she called out to him saying,
"O Muslim, come and wrestle before the daybreak!" and tucked up her
sleeves, showing a fore-arm like fresh curd; the whole place was
lighted up by its whiteness and Sherkan was dazzled by it. Then he
bent forward and clapped his hands, and she did the like, and they
took hold and gripped each other. He laid his hands on her slender
waist ... and fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the
hurricane. So she lifted him up, and throwing him to the ground sat
down on his breast. Then she said to him, "O Muslim, it is lawful
among you to kill Christians: what sayest thou to my killing thee?"
"O my lady," replied he, "as for killing me, it is unlawful; for
our Prophet (whom God bless and preserve!) hath forbidden the
slaying of women and children and old men and monks." "Since this
was revealed unto your prophet," rejoined she, "it behooves us to
be even with him therein; so rise: I give thee thy life, for
beneficence is not lost upon men." Then she got up, and he rose and
brushed the earth from his head, and she said to him, "Be not
abashed; but indeed one who enters the land of the Greeks in quest
of booty and to succor kings against kings, how comes it that there
is no strength in him to defend himself against a woman?" "It was
not lack of strength in me," replied he, "nor was it thy strength
that overthrew me, but thy beauty; so if thou wilt, grant me
another bout, it will be of thy favor." She laughed and said, "I
grant thee this: but these damsels have been long bound, and their
arms and shoulders are weary, and it were fitting I should loose
them, since this next bout may peradventure be a long one." Then
she went up to the girls, and unbinding them said to them in the
Greek tongue, "Go and put yourselves in safety, till I have brought
to naught this Muslim." So they went away, whilst Sherkan looked at
them, and they gazed at him and the young lady. Then he and she
drew near again and set to.... But [again by admiration of her
beauty] his strength failed him, and she feeling this, lifted him
in her hands swifter than the blinding lightning and threw him to
the ground. He fell on his back, and she said to him, "Rise: I give
thee thy life a second time. I spared thee before for the sake of
thy prophet, for that he forbade the killing of women, and I do so
this second time because of thy weakness and tender age, and
strangerhood: but I charge thee, if there be in the army sent by
King Omar ben Ennuman a stronger than thou, send him hither and
tell him of me." "By Allah, O my lady," replied Sherkan (and indeed
he was greatly incensed against her), "it was not by thy strength
that thou overthrewest me, but by [thy beauty], so that nor wit nor
foresight was left in me. But now, if thou have a mind to try
another fall with me, with my wits about me, I have a right to this
one bout more by the rules of the game, for my presence of mind has
now returned to me." "Hast thou not had enough of wrestling, O
conquered one?" rejoined she. "However, come, if thou wilt: but
know that this bout must be the last." Then they took hold of each
other, and he set to in earnest and warded himself against being
thrown down: so they wrestled awhile and the damsel found in him
strength such as she had not before observed, and said to him, "O
Muslim, thou art on thy guard!" "Yes," replied he, "thou knowest
that there remaineth but this bout, and after each of us will go
his own way." She laughed and he laughed too: then she seized the
opportunity to bore in upon him unawares, and gripping him by the
thigh, threw him to the ground, so that he fell on his back. She
laughed at him and said, "Thou art surely an eater of bran: for
thou art like a Bedouin bonnet that falls off at a touch, or a
child's toy that a puff of air overturns. Out on thee, thou poor
creature! Go back to the army of the Muslims and send us other than
thyself, for thou lackest thews; and cry as among the Arabs and
Persians and Turks and Medes, 'Whoso has might in him let him come
to us!'" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the
stream and said to Sherkan laughing, "It goes to my heart to part
with thee! get thee to thy friends, O my lord, before the morning,
lest the knights come upon thee and take thee on the points of
their lances. Thou hast not strength enough to defend thee against
women; so how couldst thou make head against men and cavaliers!"
And she turned to go back to the monastery. Sherkan was confounded,
and called out to her, saying "O my lady! Wilt thou go away, and
leave the wretched stranger, the broken-hearted slave of love?" So
she turned to him laughing, and said, "What wouldst thou? I grant
thy prayer." "Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the
sweetness of thy favors," replied Sherkan, "and shall I return
without eating of thy victual and tasting of thy hospitality?
Indeed, I am become one of thy servitors." Quoth she, "None but the
base refuses hospitality: on my head and eyes be it! Do me the
favor to mount and ride along the stream, abreast of me, for thou
art my guest." At this Sherkan rejoiced, and hastening back to his
horse, mounted and rode along the river-bank, keeping abreast of
her, till he came to a drawbridge that hung by pulleys and chains
of steel, made fast with hooks and padlocks. Here stood the ten
damsels awaiting the lady, who spoke to one of them in the Greek
tongue and said to her, "Go to him; take his horse's rein and bring
him over into the monastery."... They went on till they reached a
vaulted gate, arched over with marble. This she opened, and entered
with Sherkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten arches, from
each of which hung a lamp of crystal, shining like the rays of the
sun. The damsels met her at the end of the vestibule, bearing
perfumed flambeaux and having on their heads kerchiefs embroidered
with all manner of jewels, and went on before her, till they came
to the inward of the monastery, where Sherkan saw couches set up
all around, facing one another and overhung with curtains spangled
with gold. The floor was paved with all kinds of variegated
marbles, and in the midst was a basin of water with four and twenty
spouts of gold around it from which issued water like liquid
silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne covered with silks
of royal purple. Then said the damsel, "O my lord, mount this
throne." So he seated himself on it, and she withdrew: and when she
had been absent awhile, he asked the servants of her, and they
said, "She hath gone to her sleeping-chamber; but we will serve
thee as thou shalt order." So they set before him rare meats, and
he ate till he was satisfied, when they brought him a basin of gold
and an ewer of silver and he washed his hands. Then his mind
reverted to his troops, and he was troubled, knowing not what had
befallen them in his absence and thinking how he had forgotten his
father's injunctions, so that he abode, oppressed with anxiety and
repenting of what he had done, till the dawn broke and the day
appeared, when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in the sea
of melancholy, repeating the following verses:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I lack not of prudence, and yet in this case, I've been
fooled;</p>
<p class="i7">so what shift shall avail unto me?</p>
<p>If any could ease me of love and its stress, Of my might and</p>
<p class="i7">my virtue I'd set myself free.</p>
<p>But alas! my heart's lost in maze of desire, And no helper
save</p>
<p class="i7">God in my strait can I see.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Hardly had he finished when up came more than twenty damsels
like moons, encompassing the young lady, who appeared among them as
the full moon among stars. She was clad in royal brocade, and girt
with a woven girdle set with various kinds of jewels that straitly
clasped her waist.... On her head she wore a network of pearls,
gemmed with various kinds of jewels, and she moved with a
coquettish, swimming gait, swaying wonder-gracefully, whilst the
damsels held up her skirts.... She fixed her eyes on him, and
considered him awhile, till she was assured of him, when she came
up to him and said, "Indeed the place is honored and illumined with
thy presence, O Sherkan! How didst thou pass the night, O hero,
after we went away and left thee? Verily, lying is a defect and a
reproach in kings; especially in great kings: and thou art Sherkan,
son of King Omar ben Ennuman; so henceforth tell me naught but
truth, and strive not to keep the secret of thy condition, for
falsehood engenders hatred and enmity. The arrow of destiny hath
fallen upon thee, and it behooves thee to show resignation and
submission." When Sherkan heard what she said, he saw nothing for
it but to tell her the truth: so he said, "I am indeed Sherkan, son
of Omar ben Ennuman; whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this
place: so now do whatsoever thou wilt."</p>

<br>
<p>There lived in the city of Bagdad, during the reign of the
Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, a man named Sindbad the
Hammal [Porter], one in poor case, who bore burdens on his head for
hire. It happened to him one day of great heat that whilst he was
carrying a heavy load, he became exceeding weary and sweated
profusely; the heat and the weight alike oppressing him. Presently,
as he was passing the gate of a merchant's house, before which the
ground was swept and watered, and where the air was temperate, he
sighted a broad bench beside the door; so he set his load thereon,
to take rest and smell the air.--</p>
<p>And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>
<p>NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-SEVENTH NIGHT,</p>
<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
Hammal set his load upon the bench to take rest and smell the air,
there came out upon him from the court-door a pleasant breeze and a
delicious fragrance. He sat down on the edge of the bench, and at
once heard from within the melodious sound of lutes and other
stringed instruments, and mirth-exciting voices singing and
reciting, together with the song of birds warbling and glorifying
Almighty Allah in various tunes and tongues; turtles, mockingbirds,
merles, nightingales, cushats, and stone-curlews: whereat he
marveled in himself and was moved to mighty joy and solace. Then he
went up to the gate and saw within a great flower-garden wherein
were pages and black slaves, and such a train of servants and
attendants and so forth as is found only with Kings and Sultans;
and his nostrils were greeted with the savory odors of all manner
meats rich and delicate, and delicious and generous wines. So he
raised his eyes heavenwards and said, "Glory to Thee, O Lord, O
Creator and Provider, who providest whomso Thou wilt without count
or stint! O mine Holy One, I cry Thee pardon for all sins and turn
to Thee repenting of all offenses! O Lord, there is no gainsaying
Thee in Thine ordinance and Thy dominion, neither wilt Thou be
questioned of that Thou dost, for Thou indeed over all things art
Almighty! Extolled be Thy perfection: whom Thou wilt Thou makest
poor and whom Thou wilt Thou makest rich! Whom Thou wilt Thou
exaltest and whom Thou wilt Thou abasest, and there is no god but
Thou! How mighty is Thy majesty and how enduring Thy dominion and
how excellent Thy government! Verily, Thou favorest whom Thou wilt
of Thy servants, whereby the owner of this place abideth in all
joyance of life and delighteth himself with pleasant scents and
delicious meats and exquisite wines of all kinds. For indeed Thou
appointest unto Thy creatures that which Thou wilt and that which
Thou hast foreordained unto them; wherefore are some weary and
others are at rest, and some enjoy fair fortune and affluence
whilst others suffer the extreme of travail and misery, even as I
do." And he fell to reciting:</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>How many by my labors, that evermore endure, All goods of</p>
<p class="i2">life enjoy and in cooly shade recline?</p>
<p>Each morn that dawns I wake in travail and in woe, And</p>
<p class="i2">strange is my condition and my burden gars me
pine:</p>
<p>Many others are in luck and from miseries are free, And
Fortune</p>
<p class="i2">never loads them with loads the like o' mine:</p>
<p>They live their happy days in all solace and delight; Eat,
drink,</p>
<p class="i2">and dwell in honor 'mid the noble and the digne:</p>
<p>All living things were made of a little drop of sperm, Thine</p>
<p class="i2">origin is mine and my provenance is thine;</p>
<p>Yet the difference and distance 'twixt the twain of us are far
As</p>
<p class="i2">the difference of savor 'twixt vinegar and wine:</p>

</div>
<p>When Sindbad the Porter had made an end of reciting his verses,
he bore up his burden and was about to fare on, when there came
forth to him from the gate a little foot-page, fair of face and
shapely of shape and dainty of dress, who caught him by the hand,
saying, "Come in and speak with my lord, for he calleth for thee."
The Porter would have excused himself to the page, but the lad
would take no refusal; so he left his load with the doorkeeper in
the vestibule and followed the boy into the house, which he found
to be a goodly mansion, radiant and full of majesty, till he
brought him to a grand sitting-room wherein he saw a company of
nobles and great lords, seated at tables garnished with all manner
of flowers and sweet-scented herbs, besides great plenty of dainty
viands and fruits dried and fresh and confections and wines of the
choicest vintages. There also were instruments of music and mirth,
and lovely slave-girls playing and singing. All the company was
ranged according to rank, and in the highest place sat a man of
worshipful and noble aspect, whose beard-sides hoariness had
stricken; and he was stately of stature and fair of favor,
agreeable of aspect and full of gravity and dignity and majesty. So
Sindbad the Porter was confounded at that which he beheld, and said
in himself, "By Allah, this must be either a piece of Paradise or
some king's palace!" Then he saluted the company with much respect,
praying for their prosperity; and kissing ground before them, stood
with his head bowed down in humble attitude.--</p>
<p>And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>
<p>NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-EIGHTH NIGHT,</p>
<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sindbad
the Porter, after kissing ground between their hands, stood with
his head bowed down in humble attitude. The master of the house
bade him draw near and be seated and bespoke him kindly, bidding
him welcome. Then he set before him various kinds of viands, rich
and delicious, and the Porter, after saying his Bismillah, fell to
and ate his fill, after which he exclaimed, "Praised be Allah
whatso be our case!" and washing his hands, returned thanks to the
company for his entertainment. Quoth the host, "Thou art welcome
and thy day is a-blessed. But what are thy name and calling?" Quoth
the other, "O my lord, my name is Sindbad the Hammal, and I carry
folk's goods on my head for hire." The house-master smiled and
rejoined, "Know, O Porter, that thy name is even as mine, for I am
Sindbad the Seaman; and now, O Porter, I would have thee let me
hear the couplets thou recitedst at the gate anon." The Porter was
abashed and replied, "Allah upon thee! Excuse me, for toil and
travail and lack of luck when the hand is empty teach a man ill
manners and boorish ways." Said the host, "Be not ashamed; thou art
become my brother: but repeat to me the verses, for they pleased me
whenas I heard thee recite them at the gate." Hereupon the Porter
repeated the couplets, and they delighted the merchant, who said to
him:--</p>
<p>Know, O Hammal, that my story is a wonderful one, and thou shalt
hear all that befell me and all I underwent ere I rose to this
state of prosperity and became the lord of this place wherein thou
seest me; for I came not to this high estate save after travail
sore and perils galore, and how much toil and trouble have I not
suffered in days of yore! I have made seven voyages, by each of
which hangeth a marvelous tale, such as confoundeth the reason, and
all this came to pass by doom of fortune and fate; for from what
destiny doth write there is neither refuge nor flight.</p>
<p>Know then, good my lords (continued he), that I am about to
relate the</p>
<h2><a name="FIRST_VOYAGE_OF_SINDBAD_HIGHT_THE_SEAMAN."></a>FIRST
VOYAGE OF SINDBAD HIGHT THE SEAMAN.</h2>
<p>My father was a merchant, one of the notables of my native
place, a moneyed man and ample of means, who died whilst I was yet
a child, leaving me much wealth in money and lands, and farmhouses.
When I grew up I laid hands on the whole and ate of the best and
drank freely and wore rich clothes and lived lavishly, companioning
and consorting with youths of my own age, and considering that this
course of life would continue for ever and ken no change. Thus did
I for a long time, but at last I awoke from my heedlessness, and
returning to my senses, I found my wealth had become unwealth and
my condition ill-conditioned, and all I once hent had left my hand.
And recovering my reason I was stricken with dismay and confusion,
and bethought me of a saying of our lord Solomon, son of David,
(upon whom be Peace!) which I had heard aforetime from my father,
"Three things are better than other three: the day of death is
better than the day of birth, a live dog is better than a dead
lion, and the grave is better than want." Then I got together my
remains of estates and property and sold all, even my clothes, for
three thousand dirhams, with which I resolved to travel to foreign
parts, remembering the saying of the poet:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>By means of toil man shall scale the height; Who to fame</p>
<p class="i5">aspires mustn't sleep o' night:</p>
<p>Who seeketh pearl in the deep must dive, Winning weal and</p>
<p class="i5">wealth by his main and might:</p>
<p>And who seeketh Fame without toil and strife Th' impossible</p>
<p class="i5">seeketh and wasteth life.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So taking heart I bought me goods, merchandise, and all needed
for a voyage, and, impatient to be at sea, I embarked, with a
company of merchants, on board a ship bound for Bassorah. There we
again embarked and sailed many days and nights, and we passed from
isle to isle and sea to sea and shore to shore, buying and selling
and bartering everywhere the ship touched, and continued our course
till we came to an island as it were a garth of the garden of
Paradise. Here the captain cast anchor, and making fast to the
shore, put out the landing planks. So all on board landed and made
furnaces, and lighting fires therein, busied themselves in various
ways, some cooking and some washing, whilst other some walked about
the island for solace, and the crew fell to eating and drinking and
playing and sporting. I was one of the walkers; but as we were thus
engaged, behold the master, who was standing on the gunwale, cried
out to us at the top of his voice, saying, "Ho there! passengers,
run for your lives and hasten back to the ship and leave your gear
and save yourselves from destruction, Allah preserve you! For this
island whereon ye stand is no true island, but a great fish
stationary a-middlemost of the sea, whereon the sand hath settled
and trees have sprung up of old time, so that it is become like
unto an island; but when ye lighted fires on it, it felt the heat
and moved; and in a moment it will sink with you into the sea and
ye will all be drowned. So leave your gear and seek your safety ere
ye die."--</p>
<p>And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>
<br>
<h3>NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-NINTH NIGHT,</h3>
<p>She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the
ship-master cried to the passengers, "Leave your gear and seek
safety ere ye die," all who heard him left gear and goods, clothes
washed and unwashed, fire-pots and brass cooking-pots, and fled
back to the ship for their lives, and some reached it while others
(among whom was I) did not, for suddenly the island shook and sank
into the abysses of the deep, with all that were thereon, and the
dashing sea surged over it with clashing waves. I sank with the
others down, down into the deep, but Almighty Allah preserved me
from drowning and threw in my way a great wooden tub of those that
had served the ship's company for tubbing. I gripped it for the
sweetness of life, and bestriding it like one riding, paddled with
my feet like oars, whilst the waves tossed me as in sport right and
left. Meanwhile, the captain made sail and departed with those who
had reached the ship, regardless of the drowning and the drowned;
and I ceased not following the vessel with my eyes, till she was
hid from sight and I made sure of death. Darkness closed in upon me
while in this plight, and the winds and waves bore me on all that
night and the next day, till the tub brought to with me under the
lee of a lofty island, with trees overhanging the tide. I caught
hold of a branch and by its aid clambered up on to the land, after
coming nigh upon death; but when I reached the shore, I found my
legs cramped and numbed, and my feet bore traces of the nibbling of
fish upon their soles; withal I had felt nothing for excess of
anguish and fatigue. I threw myself down on the island-ground, like
a dead man, and drowned in desolation swooned away, nor did I
return to my senses till next morning, when the sun rose and
revived me. But I found my feet swollen, so made shift to move by
shuffling on my breech and crawling on my knees, for in that island
were found store of fruit and springs of sweet water. I ate of the
fruits, which strengthened me; and thus I abode days and nights,
till my life seemed to return and my spirits began to revive and I
was better able to move about. So after due consideration I fell to
exploring the island and diverting myself with gazing upon all
things that Allah Almighty had created there; and rested under the
trees, from one of which I cut me a staff to lean upon. One day as
I walked along the marge, I caught sight of some object in the
distance, and thought it a wild beast or one of the monster
creatures of the sea; but as I drew near it, looking hard the
while, I saw that it was a noble mare, tethered on the beach.
Presently I went up to her, but she cried out against me with a
great cry, so that I trembled for fear and turned to go away, when
there came forth a man from under the earth and followed me, crying
out and saying, "Who and whence art thou, and what caused thee to
come hither?" "O my lord," answered I, "I am in very sooth a waif,
a stranger, and was left to drown with sundry others by the ship we
voyaged in; but Allah graciously sent me a wooden tub, so I saved
myself thereon, and it floated with me till the waves cast me up on
this island." When he heard this he took my hand, and saying "Come
with me," carried me into a great Sard&aacute;b, or underground
chamber, which was spacious as a saloon. He made me sit down at its
upper end; then he brought me somewhat of food, and, being
anhungered, I ate till I was satisfied and refreshed. And when he
had put me at mine ease he questioned me of myself, and I told him
all that had befallen me from first to last. And as he wondered at
my adventure, I said, "By Allah, O my lord, excuse me; I have told
thee the truth of my case and the accident which betided me. And
now I desire that thou tell me who thou art, and why thou abidest
here under the earth, and why thou hast tethered yonder mare on the
brink of the sea." Answered he, "Know that I am one of the several
who are stationed in different parts of this island, and we are of
the grooms of King Mihrj&aacute;n, and under our hand are all his
horses.... And Inshallah! I will bear thee to King
Mihrj&aacute;n--"</p>
<p>And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>
<br>
<h3>NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTIETH NIGHT,</h3>
<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the
Syce said to Sindbad the Seaman, "I will bear thee to King
Mihrj&aacute;n and show thee our country. And know that hadst thou
not happened on us, thou hadst perished miserably and none had
known of thee; but I will be the means of the saving of thy life
and of thy return to thine own land." I called down blessings on
him and thanked him for his kindness and courtesy.... After this,
we sat awhile, till the rest of the grooms came up, each leading a
mare, and seeing me with their fellow Syce questioned me of my
case, and I repeated my story to them. Thereupon they drew near me,
and spreading the table, ate and invited me to eat; so I ate with
them, after which they took horse, and mounting me on one of the
mares, set out with me and fared on without ceasing, till we came
to the capital city of King Mihrj&aacute;n, and going in to him
acquainted him with my story. Then he sent for me, and when they
set me before him and salams had been exchanged, he gave me a
cordial welcome and wishing me long life bade me tell him my tale.
So I related to him all that I had seen and all that had befallen
me from first to last, whereat he marveled and said to me, "By
Allah, O my son, thou hast indeed been miraculously preserved! Were
not the term of thy life a long one, thou hadst not escaped from
these straits; but praised be Allah for safety!" Then he spoke
cheerily to me and entreated me with kindness and consideration;
moreover, he made me his agent for the port and registrar of all
ships that entered the harbor. I attended him regularly, to receive
his commandments, and he favored me and did me all manner of
kindness and invested me with costly and splendid robes. Indeed, I
was high in credit with him, as an intercessor for the folk and an
intermediary between them and him, when they wanted aught of him. I
abode thus a great while, and as often as I passed through the city
to the port, I questioned the merchants and travelers and sailors
of the city of Baghdad; so haply I might hear of an occasion to
return to my native land, but could find none who knew it or knew
any who resorted thither. At this I was chagrined, for I was weary
of long strangerhood; and my disappointment endured for a time till
one day, going in to King Mihrj&aacute;n, I found with him a
company of Indians. I saluted them and they returned my salam; and
politely welcomed me and asked me of my country--</p>
<p>And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her
permitted say.</p>
<br>
<h3>NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-FIRST NIGHT,</h3>
<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that
Sindbad the Seaman said:--When they asked me of my country I
questioned them of theirs, and they told me that they were of
various castes, some being called Shakiriyah, who are the noblest
of their castes and neither oppress nor offer violence to any, and
other Brahmans, a folk who abstain from wine, but live in delight
and solace and merriment, and own camels and horses and cattle.
Moreover, they told me that the people of India are divided into
two-and-seventy castes, and I marveled at this with exceeding
marvel. Amongst other things that I saw in King Mihrj&aacute;n's
dominions was an island called K&aacute;sil, wherein all night is
heard the beating of drums and tabrets; but we were told by the
neighboring islanders and by travelers that the inhabitants are
people of diligence and judgment. In this sea I saw also a fish two
hundred cubits long, and the fishermen fear it; so they strike
together pieces of wood and put it to flight. I also saw another
fish, with a head like that of an owl, besides many other wonders
and rarities, which it would be tedious to recount. I occupied
myself thus in visiting the islands, till one day, as I stood in
the port, with a staff in my hand, according to my custom, behold,
a great ship, wherein were many merchants, came sailing for the
harbor. When it reached the small inner port where ships anchor
under the city, the master furled his sails and making fast to the
shore, put out the landing-planks, whereupon the crew fell to
breaking bulk and landing cargo whilst I stood by, taking written
note of them. They were long in bringing the goods ashore, so I
asked the master, "Is there aught left in thy ship?" and he
answered, "O my lord, there are divers bales of merchandise in the
hold, whose owner was drowned from amongst us at one of the islands
on our course; so his goods remained in our charge by way of trust,
and we propose to sell them and note their price, that we may
convey it to his people in the city of Baghdad, the Home of Peace."
"What was the merchant's name?" quoth I, and quoth he, "Sindbad the
Seaman"; whereupon I straitly considered him and knowing him, cried
out to him with a great cry, saying, "O captain, I am that Sindbad
the Seaman who traveled with other merchants; and when the fish
heaved and thou calledst to us, some saved themselves and others
sank, I being one of them. But Allah Almighty threw in my way a
great tub of wood, of those the crew had used to wash withal, and
the winds and waves carried me to this island, where by Allah's
grace I fell in with King Mihrj&aacute;n's grooms and they brought
me hither to the King their master. When I told him my story he
entreated me with favor and made me his harbor-master, and I have
prospered in his service and found acceptance with him. These
bales, therefore, are mine, the goods which God hath given
me--"</p>
<p>And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her
permitted say.</p>
<br>
<h3>NOW WHEN IT WAS THE FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY-SECOND NIGHT,</h3>
<p>She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when
Sindbad the Seaman said to the captain, "These bales are mine, the
goods which Allah hath given me," the other exclaimed, "There is no
Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the
Great! Verily, there is neither conscience nor good faith left
among men!" Said I, "O Rais, what mean these words, seeing that I
have told thee my case?" And he answered, "Because thou heardest me
say that I had with me goods whose owner was drowned, thou thinkest
to take them without right; but this is forbidden by law to thee,
for we saw him drown before our eyes, together with many other
passengers, nor was one of them saved. So how canst thou pretend
that thou art the owner of the goods?" "O captain," said I, "listen
to my story and give heed to my words, and my truth will be
manifest to thee; for lying and leasing are the letter-marks of the
hypocrites." Then I recounted to him all that had befallen me since
I sailed from Baghdad with him to the time when we came to the
fish-island where we were nearly drowned; and I reminded him of
certain matters which had passed between us; whereupon both he and
the merchants were certified of the truth of my story and
recognized me and gave me joy of my deliverance, saying, "By Allah,
we thought not that thou hadst escaped drowning! But the Lord hath
granted thee new life." Then they delivered my bales to me, and I
found my name written thereon, nor was aught thereof lacking. So I
opened them, and making up a present for King Mihrj&aacute;n of the
finest and costliest of the contents, caused the sailors to carry
it up to the palace, where I went in to the King and laid my
present at his feet acquainting him with what had happened,
especially concerning the ship and my goods; whereat he wondered
with exceeding wonder and the truth of all that I had told him was
made manifest to him. His affection for me redoubled after that,
and he showed me exceeding honor and bestowed on me a great present
in return for mine. Then I sold my bales and what other matters I
owned, making a great profit on them, and bought me other goods and
gear of the growth and fashion of the island-city. When the
merchants were about to start on their homeward voyage, I embarked
on board the ship all that I possessed, and going in to the King,
thanked him for all his favors and friendship, and craved his leave
to return to my own land and friends. He farewelled me and bestowed
upon me great store of the country-stuffs and produce; and I took
leave of him and embarked. Then we set sail and fared on nights and
days, by the permission of Allah Almighty; and Fortune served us
and Fate favored us, so that we arrived in safety at Bassorah-city
where I landed rejoiced at my safe return to my natal soil. After a
short stay, I set out for Baghdad, the House of Peace, with store
of goods and commodities of great price. Reaching the city in due
time, I went straight to my own quarter and entered my house, where
all my friends and kinsfolk came to greet me. Then I bought me
eunuchs and concubines, servants and negro slaves, till I had a
large establishment, and I bought me houses, and lands and gardens,
till I was richer and in better case than before, and returned to
enjoy the society of my friends and familiars more assiduously than
ever, forgetting all I had suffered of fatigue and hardship and
strangerhood and every peril of travel; and I applied myself to all
manner joys and solaces and delights, eating the daintiest viands
and drinking the deliciousest wines; and my wealth allowed this
state of things to endure. This, then, is the story of my first
voyage, and to-morrow, Inshallah! I will tell you the tale of the
second of my seven voyages. Saith he who telleth the tale: Then
Sindbad the Seaman made Sindbad the Landsman sup with him and bade
give him an hundred gold pieces, saying, "Thou hast cheered us with
thy company this day." The Porter thanked him, and taking the gift,
went his way, pondering that which he had heard and marveling
mightily at what things betide mankind.</p>

"CONCLUSION_OF_THE_'THOUSAND_NIGHTS_AND_A_NIGHT'"></a>CONCLUSION OF
THE 'THOUSAND NIGHTS AND A NIGHT'</h2>
<center>Translation of Captain Sir Richard F. Burton</center>
<br>
<p>Now during this time Shahrazad had borne the King three boy
children; so, when she had made an end of the story of Ma'aruf, she
rose to her feet and kissing ground before him, said, "O King of
the time and unique one of the age and the tide, I am thine
handmaid, and these thousand nights and a night have I entertained
thee with stories of folk gone before and admonitory instances of
the men of yore. May I then make bold to crave a boon of thy
highness?" He replied, "Ask, O Shahrazad, and it shall be granted
to thee." Whereupon she cried out to the nurses and the eunuchs,
saying, "Bring me my children." So they brought them to her in
haste, and they were three boy children, one walking, one crawling,
and one sucking. She took them, and setting them before the King,
again kissed ground and said, "O King of the Age, these are thy
children and I crave that thou release me from the doom of death,
as a dole to these infants; for, an thou kill me, they will become
motherless and will find none among women to rear them as they
should be reared." When the King heard this, he wept and straining
the boys to his bosom, said, "By Allah, O Shahrazad, I pardoned
thee before the coming of these children, for that I found thee
chaste, pure, ingenuous, and pious! Allah bless thee and thy father
and thy mother and thy root and thy branch! I take the Almighty to
witness against me that I exempt thee from aught that can harm
thee."</p>
<p>So she kissed his hands and feet and rejoiced with exceeding
joy, saying, "The Lord make thy life long and increase thee in
dignity and majesty!" presently adding, "Thou marveledst at which
befell thee on the part of women; yet there betided the Kings of
the Chosro&euml;s before thee greater mishaps and more grievous
than that which hath befallen thee, and indeed I have set forth
unto thee that which happened to Caliphs and Kings and others with
their women, but the relation is longsome, and hearkening groweth
tedious, and in this is all-sufficient warning for the man of wits
and admonishment for the wise." Then she ceased to speak, and when
King Shahryar heard her speech and profited by that which she had
said, he summoned up his reasoning powers and cleansed his heart
and caused his understanding to revert, and turned to Allah
Almighty and said to himself, "Since there befell the Kings of the
Chosro&euml;s more than that which hath befallen me, never whilst I
live shall I cease to blame myself for the past. As for this
Shahrazad, her like is not found in the lands; so praise be to Him
Who appointed her a means for delivering His creatures from
oppression and slaughter!" Then he arose from his s&eacute;ance and
kissed her head, whereat she rejoiced, she and her sister Dunyazad,
with exceeding joy.</p>
<p>When the morning morrowed the King went forth, and sitting down
on the throne of the Kingship, summoned the Lords of his land;
whereupon the Chamberlains and Nabobs and Captains of the host went
in to him and kissed ground before him. He distinguished the Wazir,
Shahrazad's sire, with special favor and bestowed on him a costly
and splendid robe of honor, and entreated him with the utmost
kindness, and said to him, "Allah protect thee for that thou gavest
me to wife thy noble daughter, who hath been the means of my
repentance from slaying the daughters of folk. Indeed, I have found
her pure and pious, chaste and ingenuous, and Allah hath vouchsafed
me by her three boy children; wherefore praised be He for His
passing favor." Then he bestowed robes of honor upon his Wazirs and
Emirs and Chief Officers and he set forth to them briefly that
which had betided him with Shahrazad, and how he had turned from
his former ways and repented him of what he had done, and proposed
to take the Wazir's daughter Shahrazad to wife, and let draw up the
marriage-contract with her. When those who were present heard this,
they kissed ground before him and blessed him and his betrothed
Shahrazad, and the Wazir thanked her.</p>
<p>Then Shahryar made an end of his sitting in all weal, whereupon
the folk dispersed to their dwelling-places, and the news was
bruited abroad that the King proposed to marry the Wazir's
daughter, Shahrazad. Then he proceeded to make ready the wedding
gear, and presently he sent after his brother, King Shah Zaman, who
came, and King Shahryar went forth to meet him with the troops.
Furthermore, they decorated the city after the goodliest fashion
and diffused scents from censers and burnt aloes-wood and other
perfumes in all the markets and thoroughfares and rubbed themselves
with saffron, what while the drums beat and the flutes and pipes
sounded and mimes and mountebanks played and plied their arts, and
the King lavished on them gifts and largesse, and in very deed it
was a notable day. When they came to the palace, King Shahryar
commanded to spread the table with beasts roasted whole, and
sweetmeats, and all manner of viands, and bade the crier cry to the
folk that they should come up to the Diwan and eat and drink, and
that this should be a means of reconciliation between him and them.
So high and low, great and small, came up unto him, and they abode
on that wise, eating and drinking, seven days with their
nights.</p>
<p>Then the King shut himself up with his brother, and related to
him that which had betided him with the Wazir's daughter Shahrazad
during the past three years, and told him what he had heard from
her of proverbs and parables, chronicles and pleasantries, quips
and jests, stories and anecdotes, dialogues and histories, and
elegies and other verses; whereat King Shah Zaman marveled with the
utmost marvel and said, "Fain would I take her younger sister to
wife, so we may be two brothers-german to two sisters-german, and
they on like wise be sisters to us; for that the calamity which
befell me was the cause of our discovering that which befell thee,
and all this time of three years past I have taken no delight in
woman; but now I desire to marry thy wife's sister Dunyazad."</p>
<p>When King Shahryar heard his brother's words, he rejoiced with
joy exceeding, and arising forthright, went in to his wife
Shahrazad and acquainted her with that which his brother purposed,
namely, that he sought her sister Dunyazad in wedlock; whereupon
she answered, "O King of the Age, we seek of him one condition, to
wit, that he take up his abode with us, for that I cannot brook to
be parted from my sister an hour, because we were brought up
together, and may not endure separation each from another. If he
accept this pact, she is his handmaid." King Shahryar returned to
his brother and acquainted him with that which Shahrazad had said;
and he replied, "Indeed, this is what was in my mind, for that I
desire nevermore to be parted from thee one hour. As for the
kingdom, Allah the Most High shall send to it whomso He chooseth,
for that I have no longer a desire for the kingship."</p>
<p>When King Shahryar heard his brother's words, he rejoiced
exceedingly and said, "Verily, this is what I wished, O my brother.
So Alhamdolillah--Praised be Allah!--who hath brought about union
between us." Then he sent after the Kazis and Olema, Captains and
Notables, and they married the two brothers to the two sisters. The
contracts were written out, and the two Kings bestowed robes of
honor of silk and satin on those who were present, whilst the city
was decorated and the rejoicings were renewed. The King commanded
each Emir and Wazir and Chamberlain and Nabob to decorate his
palace, and the folk of the city were gladdened by the presage of
happiness and contentment. King Shahryar also bade slaughter sheep,
and set up kitchens and made bride-feasts and fed all comers, high
and low; and he gave alms to the poor and needy and extended his
bounty to great and small.</p>
<p>Then the eunuchs went forth that they might perfume the Hammam
for the brides; so they scented it with rosewater and willow-flower
water and pods of musk, and fumigated it with K&aacute;kil&iacute;
eaglewood and ambergris. Then Shahrazad entered, she and her sister
Dunyazad, and they cleansed their heads and clipped their hair.
When they came forth of the Hammam-bath, they donned raiment and
ornaments, such as men were wont prepare for the Kings of the
Chosro&euml;s; and among Shahrazad's apparel was a dress purfled
with red gold and wrought with counterfeit presentments of birds
and beasts. And the two sisters encircled their necks with
necklaces of jewels of price, in the like whereof Iskander rejoiced
not, for therein were great jewels such as amazed the wit and
dazzled the eye; and the imagination was bewildered at their
charms, for indeed each of them was brighter than the sun and the
moon. Before them they lighted brilliant flambeaux of wax in
candelabra of gold, but their faces outshone the flambeaux, for
that they had eyes sharper than unsheathed swords and the lashes of
their eyelids bewitched all hearts. Their cheeks were rosy red, and
their necks and shapes gracefully swayed, and their eyes wantoned
like the gazelle's; and the slave-girls came to meet them with
instruments of music.</p>
<p>Then the two Kings entered the Hammam-bath, and when they came
forth they sat down on a couch set with pearls and gems, whereupon
the two sisters came up to them and stood between their hands, as
they were moons, bending and leaning from side to side in their
beauty and loveliness. Presently they brought forward Shahrazad and
displayed her, for the first dress, in a red suit; whereupon King
Shahryar rose to look upon her, and the wits of all present, men
and women, were bewitched for that she was even as saith of her one
of her describers:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>A sun on wand in knoll of sand she showed,</p>
<p class="i5">Clad in her cramoisy-hued chemisette:</p>
<p>Of her lips' honey-dew she gave me drink</p>
<p class="i5">And with her rosy cheeks quencht fire she set.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then they attired Dunyazad in a dress of blue brocade, and she
became as she were the full moon when it shineth forth. So they
displayed her in this, for the first dress, before King Shah Zaman,
who rejoiced in her and well-nigh swooned away for love-longing and
amorous desire; yea, he was distraught with passion for her, whenas
he saw her, because she was as saith of her one of her describers
in these couplets:--</p>
<blockquote>She comes appareled in an azure vest<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ultramarine as skies are deckt and
dight:<br>
I view'd th' unparall'd sight, which showed my eyes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Summer-moon upon a
Winter-night.</blockquote>
<p>Then they returned to Shahrazad and displayed her in the second
dress, a suit of surpassing goodliness, and veiled her face with
her hair like a chin-veil. Moreover, they let down her side-locks,
and she was even as saith of her one of her describers in these
couplets:--</p>
<blockquote>O hail to him whose locks his cheeks o'ershade,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who slew my life by cruel hard
despight:<br>
Said I, "Hast veiled the Morn in Night?" He said,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nay, I but veil the Moon in hue of
Night."</blockquote>
<p>Then they displayed Dunyazad in a second and a third and a
fourth dress, and she paced forward like the rising sun, and swayed
to and fro in the insolence of her beauty; and she was even as
saith the poet of her in these couplets:--</p>
<blockquote>The sun of beauty she to all appears<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, lovely coy, she mocks all
loveliness:<br>
And when he fronts her favor and her smile<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A-morn, the sun of day in clouds must
dress.</blockquote>
<p>Then they displayed Shahrazad in the third dress and the fourth
and the fifth, and she became as she were a B&aacute;n-branch snell
of a thirsting gazelle, lovely of face and perfect in attributes of
grace, even as saith of her one in these couplets:--</p>
<blockquote>She comes like fullest moon on happy night,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taper of waist with shape of magic
might;<br>
She hath an eye whose glances quell mankind,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ruby on her cheeks reflects his
light;<br>
Enveils her hips the blackness of her hair;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware of curls that bite with
viper-bite!<br>
Her sides are silken-soft, what while the heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mere rock behind that surface 'scapes
our sight;<br>
From the fringed curtains of her cyne she shoots<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shafts that at furthest range on mark
alight.</blockquote>
<p>Then they returned to Dunyazad and displayed her in the fifth
dress and in the sixth, which was green, when she surpassed with
her loveliness the fair of the four quarters of the world, and
outvied, with the brightness of her countenance, the full moon at
rising tide; for she was even as saith of her the poet in these
couplets:--</p>
<blockquote>A damsel 'twas the tirer's art had decked with snare
and sleight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And robed with rays as though the sun
from her had borrowed light;<br>
She came before us wondrous clad in chemisette of green,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As veil&egrave;d by his leafy screen
Pomegranate hides from sight;<br>
And when he said, "How callest thou the fashion of thy dress?"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She answered us in pleasant way, with
double meaning dight,<br>
"We call this garment <i>cr&egrave;ve-coeur;</i> and rightly is it
hight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For many a heart wi' this we brake
and harried many a sprite."</blockquote>
<p>Then they displayed Shahrazad in the sixth and seventh dresses
and clad her in youth's clothing, whereupon she came forward
swaying from side to side, and coquettishly moving, and indeed she
ravished wits and hearts and ensorcelled all eyes with her glances.
She shook her sides and swayed her haunches, then put her hair on
sword-hilt and went up to King Shahryar, who embraced her as
hospitable host embraceth guest, and threatened her in her ear with
the taking of the sword; and she was even as saith of her the poet
in these words:--</p>
<blockquote>Were not the Murk of gender male,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Than feminines surpassing fair,<br>
Tire-women they had grudged the bride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who made her beard and whiskers
wear!</blockquote>
<p>Thus also they did with her sister Dunyazad; and when they had
made an end of the display, the King bestowed robes of honor on all
who were present, and sent the brides to their own apartments. Then
Shahrazad went in to King Shahryar and Dunyazad to King Shah Zaman,
and each of them solaced himself with the company of his beloved
consort, and the hearts of the folk were comforted. When morning
morrowed, the Wazir came in to the two Kings and kissed ground
before them; wherefore they thanked him and were large of bounty to
him. Presently they went forth and sat down upon couches of
kingship, whilst all the Wazirs and Emirs and Grandees and Lords of
the land presented themselves and kissed ground. King Shahryar
ordered them dresses of honor and largesse, and they prayed for the
permanence and prosperity of the King and his brother. Then the two
Sovrans appointed their sire-in-law the Wazir to be Viceroy in
Samarcand, and assigned him five of the Chief Emirs to accompany
him, charging them attend him and do him service. The Minister
kissed ground and prayed that they might be vouchsafed length of
life: then he went in to his daughters, whilst the Eunuchs and
Ushers walked before him, and saluted them and farewelled them.
They kissed his hands and gave him joy of the kingship and bestowed
on him immense treasures; after which he took leave of them, and
setting out, fared days and nights, till he came near Samarcand,
where the townspeople met him at a distance of three marches and
rejoiced in him with exceeding joy. So he entered the city, and
they decorated the houses and it was a notable day. He sat down on
the throne of his kingship, and the Wazirs did him homage and the
Grandees and Emirs of Samarcand, and all prayed that he might be
vouchsafed justice and victory and length of continuance. So he
bestowed on them robes of honor and entreated them with
distinction, and they made him Sultan over them. As soon as his
father-in-law had departed for Samarcand, King Shahryar summoned
the Grandees of his realm and made them a stupendous banquet of all
manner of delicious meats and exquisite sweetmeats. He also
bestowed on them robes of honor and guerdoned them, and divided the
kingdoms between himself and his brother in their presence, whereat
the folk rejoiced. Then the two Kings abode, each ruling a day in
turn, and they were ever in harmony each with other, while on
similar wise their wives continued in the love of Allah Almighty
and in thanksgiving to Him; and the peoples and the provinces were
at peace, and the preachers prayed for them from the pulpits, and
their report was bruited abroad and the travelers bore tidings of
them to all lands. In due time King Shahryar summoned chronicles
and copyists, and bade them write all that had betided him with his
wife, first and last; so they wrote this and named it 'The Stories
of the Thousand Nights and A Night.' The book came to thirty
volumes, and these the King laid up in his treasure. And the two
brothers abode with their wives in all pleasaunce and solace of
life and its delights, for that indeed Allah the Most High had
changed their annoy into joy; and on this wise they continued till
there took them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of
societies, the Desolator of dwelling-places, and Garnerer of
grave-yards, and they were translated to the ruth of Almighty
Allah; their houses fell waste and their palaces lay in ruins, and
the Kings inherited their riches. Then there reigned after them a
wise ruler, who was just, keen-witted, and accomplished, and loved
tales and legends, especially those which chronicle the doings of
Sovrans and Sultans, and he found in the treasury these marvelous
stories and wondrous histories, contained in the thirty volumes
aforesaid. So he read in them a first book and a second and a third
and so on to the last of them, and each book astounded and
delighted him more than that which preceded it, till he came to the
end of them. Then he admired what so he had read therein of
description and discourse and rare traits and anecdotes and moral
instances and reminiscences, and bade the folk copy them and
dispread them over all lands and climes; wherefore their report was
bruited abroad and the people named them 'The marvels and wonders
of the Thousand Nights and A Night.' This is all that hath come
down to us of the origin of this book, and Allah is All-knowing. So
Glory be to Him Whom the shifts of Time waste not away, nor doth
aught of chance or change affect His sway! Whom one case diverteth
not from other case, and Who is sole in the attributes of perfect
grace. And prayer and the Peace be upon the Lord's Pontiff and
Chosen One among His creatures, our Lord MOHAMMED the Prince of
mankind, through whom we supplicate Him for a goodly and a godly
end.</p>

<h2><a name="ARABIC_LITERATURE"></a>ARABIC LITERATURE</h2>
<h3>BY RICHARD GOTTHEIL</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-o.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>f no civilization is the complexion of its literary remains so
characteristic of its varying fortunes as is that of the Arabic.
The precarious conditions of desert life and of the tent, the more
certain existence in settled habitations, the grandeur of empire
acquired in a short period of enthusiastic rapture, the softening
influence of luxury and unwonted riches, are so faithfully
portrayed in the literature of the Arabs as to give us a picture of
the spiritual life of the people which no mere massing of facts can
ever give. Well aware of this themselves, the Arabs at an early
date commenced the collection and preservation of their old
literary monuments with a care and a studious concern which must
excite within us a feeling of wonder. For the material side of life
must have made a strong appeal to these people when they came forth
from their desert homes. Pride in their own doings, pride in their
own past, must have spurred them on; yet an ardent feeling for the
beautiful in speech is evident from the beginning of their history.
The first knowledge that we have of the tribes scattered up and
down the deserts and oases of the Arabian peninsula comes to us in
the verses of their poets. The early Teuton bards, the rhapsodists
of Greece, were not listened to with more rapt attention than was
the simple Bedouin, who, seated on his mat or at the door of his
tent, gave vent to his feelings of joy or sorrow in such manner as
nature had gifted him. As are the ballads for Scottish history, so
are the verses of these untutored bards the record of the life in
which they played no mean part. Nor could the splendors of court
life at Damascus, Bagdad, or Cordova make their rulers insensible
to the charms of poetry,--that "beautiful poetry with which Allah
has adorned the Muslim." A verse happily said could always charm, a
satire well pointed could always incite; and the true Arab of
to-day will listen to those so adorned with the same rapt attention
as did his fathers of long ago.</p>
<p>This gift of the desert--otherwise so sparing of its favors--has
not failed to leave its impression upon the whole Arabic
literature. Though it has produced some prose writers of value,
writing, as an art to charm and to please, has always sought the
measured cadence of poetry or the unmeasured symmetry of rhymed
prose. Its first lispings are in the "trembling" (r&aacute;jaz)
metre,--iambics, rhyming in the same syllable throughout; impromptu
verses, in which the poet expressed the feelings of the moment: a
measure which, the Arabs say, matches the trembling trot of the
she-camel. It is simple in its character; coming so near to rhymed
prose that Khal&iacute;l (born 718), the great grammarian, would
not willingly admit that such lines could really be called poetry.
Some of these verses go back to the fourth and fifth centuries of
our era. But a growing sense of the poet's art was incompatible
with so simple a measure; and a hundred years before the appearance
of the Prophet, many of the canonical sixteen metres were already
in vogue. Even the later complete poems bear the stamp of their
origin, in the loose connection with which the different parts
stand to each other. The "Kas&iacute;dah" (poem) is built upon the
principle that each verse must be complete in itself,--there being
no stanzas,--and separable from the context; which has made
interpolations and omissions in the older poems a matter of
ease.</p>
<p>The classical period of Arabic poetry, which reaches from the
beginning of the sixth century to the beginning of the eighth, is
dominated by this form of the Kas&iacute;dah. Tradition refers its
origin to one al-Muhalhel ibn Rab&iacute;'a of the tribe of
Taghlib, about one hundred and fifty years before Muhammad; though,
as is usual, this honor is not uncontested. The Kas&iacute;dah is
composed of distichs, the first two of which only are to rhyme;
though every line must end in the same syllable. It must have at
least seven or ten verses, and may reach up to one hundred or over.
In nearly every case it deals with a tribe or a single person,--the
poet himself or a friend,--and may be either a panegyric, a satire,
an elegy, or a eulogy. That which it is the aim of the poet to
bring out comes last; the greater part of the poem being of the
nature of a <i>captatio benevolentia</i>. Here he can show his full
power of expression. He usually commences with the description of a
deserted camping-ground, where he sees the traces of his beloved.
He then adds the erotic part, and describes at length his deeds of
valor in the chase or in war; in order, then, to lead over to the
real object he has in view. Because of this disposition of the
material, which is used by the greater poets of this time, the
general form of the Kas&iacute;dah became in a measure stereotyped.
No poem was considered perfect unless molded in this form.</p>
<p>Arabic poetry is thus entirely lyrical. There was too little,
among these tribes, of the common national life which forms the
basis for the Epos. The Semitic genius is too subjective, and has
never gotten beyond the first rude attempts at dramatic
composition. Even in its lyrics, Arabic poetry is still more
subjective than the Hebrew of the Bible. It falls generally into
the form of an allocution, even where it is descriptive. It is the
poet who speaks, and his personality pervades the whole poem. He
describes nature as he finds it, with little of the imaginative,
"in dim grand outlines of a picture which must be filled up by the
reader, guided only by a few glorious touches powerfully standing
out." A native quickness of apprehension and intense feeling
nurtured this poetic sentiment among the Arabs. The continuous
enmity among the various tribes produced a sort of knight-errantry
which gave material to the poet; and the richness of his language
put a tongue in his mouth which could voice forth the finest shades
of description or sentiment. Al-Dam&aacute;ri has wisely said:
"Wisdom has alighted upon three things,--the brain of the Franks,
the hands of the Chinese, and the tongues of the Arabs."</p>
<p>The horizon which bounded the Arab poet's view was not far drawn
out. He describes the scenes of his desert life: the sand dunes;
the camel, antelope, wild ass, and gazelle; his bow and arrow and
his sword; his loved one torn from him by the sudden striking of
the tents and departure of her tribe. The virtues which he sings
are those in which he glories, "love of freedom, independence in
thought and action, truthfulness, largeness of heart, generosity,
and hospitality." His descriptions breathe the freshness of his
outdoor life and bring us close to nature: his whole tone rings out
a solemn note, which is even in his lighter moments grave and
serious,--as existence itself was for those sons of the desert, who
had no settled habitation, and who, more than any one, depended
upon the bounty of Allah. Although these Kas&iacute;dahs passed
rapidly from mouth to mouth, little would have been preserved for
us had there not been a class of men who, led on some by desire,
some by necessity, made it their business to write down the
compositions, and to keep fresh in their memory the very
pronunciation of each word. Every poet had such a R&aacute;wiah. Of
one Hamm&aacute;d it is said that he could recite one hundred
Kas&iacute;dahs rhyming on each letter of the alphabet, each
Kas&iacute;dah having at least one hundred verses. Abu
Tamm&aacute;m (805), the author of the 'Ham&aacute;sah,' is
reported to have known by heart fourteen thousand pieces of the
metre r&aacute;jaz. It was not, however, until the end of the first
century of the H&iacute;jrah that systematic collections of this
older literature were commenced.</p>
<p>It was this very Hamm&aacute;d (died 777) who put together seven
of the choicest poems of the early Arabs. He called them 'Mu
'allak&acirc;t,'--"the hung up" (in a place of honor, in the
estimation of the people). The authors of these seven poems were:
Imr-al-Kais, T&aacute;rafa, Zuh&eacute;ir, Lab&icirc;d (570),
'Antara, 'Amr, and al-H&aacute;rith. The common verdict of their
countrymen has praised the choice made by Hamm&aacute;d. The seven
remained the great models, to which later poets aspired: in
description of love, those of Imr-al-Kais and 'Antara; in that of
the camel and the horse, Lab&icirc;d; of battle, 'Amr; in the
praise of arms, H&aacute;rith; in wise maxims, Zuh&eacute;ir. To
these must be added al-Nabighah, 'Alkamah, Urwa ibn al-Ward,
H&aacute;ssan ibn Th&aacute;bit, al-A'sha, Aus ibn H&aacute;jar,
and as-Sh&aacute;nfarah, whose poem has been called "the most
magnificent of old Arabic poems." In addition to the single poems
found in the 'Mu 'allak&acirc;t' and elsewhere, nearly all of these
composed whole series of poems, which were at a later time put in
the form of collections and called 'Diwans.' Some of these poets
have left us as many as four hundred verses. Such collections were
made by grammarians and antiquarians of a later age. In addition to
the collections made around the name of a single poet, others were
made, fashioned upon a different principle: The
'Muf&aacute;ddaliy&aacute;t' (the most excellent poems), put
together by al-Muf&aacute;ddal (761); the 'Diwan' of the poets of
the tribe of Hudh&eacute;il; the 'Ham&aacute;sah' (Bravery; so
called from the subject of the first of the ten books into which
the collection is divided) of Abu Tamm&aacute;m. The best anthology
of these poems is 'The Great Book of Songs,' put together by Abu
al-F&aacute;raj al-Ispa-h&aacute;ni (died 967).</p>
<p>With these poets Arabic literature reached its highest
development. They are the true expression of the free Arabic
spirit. Most of them lived before or during the time of the
appearance of Muhammad. His coming produced a great change in the
life of the simple Bedouins. Though they could not be called
heathen, their religion expressed itself in the simple feeling of
dependence upon higher powers, without attempting to bring this
faith into a close connection with their daily life. Muhammad
introduced a system into which he tried to mold all things. He
wished to unite the scattered tribes to one only purpose. He was
thus cutting away that untrammeled spirit and that free life which
had been the making of Arabic poetry. He knew this well. He knew
also the power the poets had over the people. His own 'Qur'an'
(Koran) was but a poor substitute for the elegant verses of his
opponents. "Imr-al-Kais," he said, "is the finest of all poets, and
their leader into everlasting fire." On another occasion he is
reported to have called out, "Verily, a belly full of matter is
better than a belly full of poetry." Even when citing verses, he
quoted them in such a manner as to destroy the metre. Abu Bekr very
properly remarked, "Truly God said in the 'Qur'an,' 'We have not
taught him poetry, and it suits him not.'" In thus decrying the
poets of "barbarism," and in setting up the 'Qur'an' as the
greatest production of Arabic genius, Muhammad was turning the
national poetry to its decline. Happily his immediate successors
were unable or unwilling to follow him strictly. Ali himself, his
son-in-law, is said to have been a poet; nor did the Um&aacute;yyid
Caliphs of Damascus, "very heathens in their carnal part," bring
the new spirit to its full bloom, as did the Abbassides of
Bagdad.</p>
<p>And yet the old spirit was gradually losing ground. The
consolidation of the empire brought greater security; the riches of
Persia and Syria produced new types of men. The centre of Arab life
was now in the city, with all its trammels, its forced politeness,
its herding together. The simplicity which characterized the early
caliphs was going; in its place was come a court,--court life,
court manners, court poets. The love of poetry was still there; but
the poet of the tent had become the poet of the house and the
palace. Like those troubadours who had become jongleurs, they lived
upon the crumbs which fell from the table of princes. Such crumbs
were often not to be despised. Many a time and oft the bard tuned
his lyre merely for the price of his services. We know that he was
richly rewarded. Har&uacute;n gave a dress worth four hundred
thousand pieces of gold to J&aacute;'far ibn Yahya; at his death,
Ibn 'Ubeid al-Buchtar&iacute; (865) left one hundred complete suits
of dress, two hundred shirts, and five hundred turbans--all of
which had been given him for his poems. The freshness of olden
times was fading little by little; the earnestness of the Bedouin
poet was making way for a lightness of heart. In this intermediate
period, few were born so happily, and yet so imbued with the new
spirit, as was 'Umar ibn 'Rab&iacute;'a (644), "the man of pleasure
as well as the man of literature." Of rich parentage, gifted with a
love of song which moved him to speak in verses, he was able to
keep himself far from both prince and palace. He was of the family
of Kure&iacute;sh, in whose Muhammad all the glories of Arabia had
centred, with one exception,--the gift of poetry. And now "this Don
Juan of Mecca, this Ovid of Arabia," was to wipe away that stain.
He was the Arabian Minnesinger, whom Friedrich R&uuml;ckert called
"the greatest love-poet the Arabs have produced." A man of the
city, the desert had no attractions for him. But he sang of love as
he made love,--with utter disregard of holy place or high station,
in an erotic strain strange to the stern Um&aacute;yyids. No wonder
they warned their children against reading his compositions. "The
greatest sin committed against Allah are the poems of 'Umar ibn
Rab&iacute;'a," they said.</p>
<p>With the rise of the Abbassides (750), that "God-favored
dynasty," Arabic literature entered upon its second great
development; a development which may be distinguished from that of
the Um&aacute;yyids (which was Arabian) as, in very truth,
Muhammadan. With Bagdad as the capital, it was rather the
non-Arabic Persians who held aloft the torch than the Arabs
descended from Kur&eacute;ish. It was a bold move, this attempt to
weld the old Persian civilization with the new Muhammadan. Yet so
great was the power of the new faith that it succeeded. The
Barmecide major-domo ably seconded his Abbasside master; the glory
of both rests upon the interest they took in art, literature, and
science. The Arab came in contact with a new world. Under
Mans&uacute;r (754), Harun al-Rashid (786), and Ma'm&uacute;n
(813), the wisdom of the Greeks in philosophy and science, the
charms of Persia and India in wit and satire, were opened up to
enlightened eyes. Upon all of these, whatever their nationality,
Islam had imposed the Arab tongue, pride in the faith and in its
early history. 'Qur'an' exegesis, philosophy, law, history, and
science were cultivated under the very eyes and at the bidding of
the Palace. And, at least for several centuries, Europe was
indebted to the culture of Bagdad for what it knew of mathematics,
astronomy, and philosophy.</p>
<p>The Arab muse profited with the rest of this revival. History
and philosophy, as a study, demanded a close acquaintance with the
products of early Arab genius. The great philologian
al-Asm&aacute;i (740-831) collected the songs and tales of the
heroic age; and a little later, with other than philological ends
in view, Abu Tamm&aacute;m and al-B&uacute;chtur&iacute; (816-913)
made the first anthologies of the old Arabic literatures
('Ham&aacute;sah'). Poetry was already cultivated: and amid the
hundreds of wits, poets, and singers who thronged the entrance to
the court, there are many who claim real poetic genius. Among them
are al-Ahtal (died 713), a Christian; 'Umar ibn Rab&iacute;'a (died
728), Jar&iacute;r al-Far&aacute;zdak (died 728), and Muslim ibn
al-Wal&iacute;d (died 828). But it is rather the Persian spirit
which rules,--the spirit of the Shahn&aacute;meh and
Firda&uacute;si,--"charming elegance, servile court flattery, and
graceful wit." In none are the characteristics so manifest as in
Abu N&uacute;was (762-819), the Poet Laureate of Harun, the
Imr-al-Kais of his time. His themes are wine and love. Everything
else he casts to the wind; and like his modern counterpart, Heine,
he drives the wit of his satire deep into the holiest feelings of
his people. "I would that all which Religion and Law forbids were
permitted me; and if I had only two years to live, that God would
change me into a dog at the Temple in Mecca, so that I might bite
every pilgrim in the leg," he is reported to have said. When he
himself did once make the required pilgrimage, he did so in order
to carry his loves up to the very walls of the sacred house.
"Jovial, adventure-loving, devil-may-care," irreligious in all he
did, yet neither the Khalif nor the whole Muhammadan world were
incensed. In spite of all, they petted him and pronounced his
wine-songs the finest ever written; full of thought and replete
with pictures, rich in language and true to every touch of nature.
"There are no poems on wine equal to my own, and to my amatory
compositions all others must yield," he himself has said. He was
poor and had to live by his talents. But wherever he went he was
richly rewarded. He was content only to be able to live in
shameless revelry and to sing. As he lived, so he died,--in a
half-drunken group, cut to pieces by those who thought themselves
offended by his lampoons.</p>
<p>At the other end of the Muslim world, the star of the
Um&aacute;yyids, which had set at Damascus, rose again at Cordova.
The union of two civilizations--Indo-Germanic and Semitic--was as
advantageous in the West as in the East. The influence of the
spirit of learning which reigned at Bagdad reached over to Spain,
and the two dynasties vied with each other in the patronage of all
that was beautiful in literature and learned in science. Poetry was
cultivated and poets cherished with a like regard: the Spanish
innate love of the Muse joined hands with that of the Arabic. It
was the same kind of poetry in Um&aacute;yyid Spain as in Abbasside
Bagdad: poetry of the city and of the palace. But another element
was added here,--the Western love for the softer beauties of
nature, and for their expression in finely worked out mosaics and
in graceful descriptions. It is this that brings the Spanish-Arabic
poetry nearer to us than the more splendid and glittering verses of
the Abbassides, or the cruder and less polished lines of the first
Muhammadans. The amount of poetry thus composed in Arab Spain may
be gauged by the fact that an anthology made during the first half
of the tenth century, by Ibn F&aacute;raj, contained twenty
thousand verses. Cordova under 'Abd-al-Rahm&aacute;n III. and
H&aacute;kim II. was the counterpart of Bagdad under Harun. "The
most learned prince that ever lived," H&aacute;kim was so renowned
a patron of literature that learned men wandered to him from all
over the Arab Empire. He collected a library of four hundred
thousand volumes, which had been gathered together by his agents in
Egypt, Syria, and Persia: the catalogue of which filled forty-four
volumes. In Cordova he founded a university and twenty-seven free
schools. What wonder that all the sciences--Tradition, Theology,
Jurisprudence, and especially History and Geography--flourished
during his reign. Of the poets of this period there may be
mentioned: Sa'&iacute;d ibn J&uacute;di--the pattern of the Knight
of those days, the poet loved of women; Y&aacute;hyah ibn Hakam,
"the gazelle"; Ahmad ibn 'Abd Rabb&iacute;h, the author of a
commonplace book; Ibn Abd&uacute;n of Badjiz, Ibn Haf&aacute;jah of
Xucar, Ibn Sa'&iacute;d of Granada. Kings added a new jewel to
their crown, and took an honored place among the bards; as 'Abd
al-Rahm&aacute;n I., and Mu'tamid (died 1095), the last King of
Seville, whose unfortunate life he himself has pictured in most
beautiful elegies. Although the short revival under the Almohades
(1184-1198) produced such men as Ibn Roshd, the commentator on
Aristotle, and Ibn Tof&eacute;il, who wrote the first 'Robinson
Crusoe' story, the sun was already setting. When Ferdinand burned
the books which had been so laboriously collected, the dying flame
of Arab culture in Spain went out.</p>
<p>During the third period--from Ma'm&uacute;n (813), under whom
the Turkish body-guards began to wield their baneful influence,
until the break-up of the Abbasside Empire in 1258--there are many
names, but few real poets, to be mentioned. The Arab spirit had
spent itself, and the Mogul cloud was on the horizon. There were
'Abd-allah ibn al-Mu'tazz, died 908; Abu Fir&aacute;s, died 967;
al-Tughrai, died 1120; al-Bus&iacute;ri, died 1279,--author of the
'B&uacute;rda,' poem in praise of Muhammad: but
al-Mutan&aacute;bbi, died 965, alone deserves special mention. The
"Prophet-pretender"--for such his name signifies--has been called
by Von Hammer "the greatest Arabian poet"; and there is no doubt
that his 'Diw&aacute;n,' with its two hundred and eighty-nine
poems, was and is widely read in the East. But it is only a
depraved taste that can prefer such an epigene to the fresh
desert-music of Imr-al-Kais. Panegyrics, songs of war and of
bloodshed, are mostly the themes that he dilates upon. He was in
the service of Saif al-D&aacute;ulah of Syria, and sang his
victories over the Byzantine Kaiser. He is the true type of the
prince's poet. Withal, the taste for poetic composition grew,
though it produced a smaller number of great poets. But it also
usurped for itself fields which belong to entirely different
literary forms. Grammar, lexicography, philosophy, and theology
were expounded in verse; but the verse was formal, stiff, and
unnatural. Poetic composition became a <i>tour de force</i>.</p>
<p>This is nowhere better seen than in that species of composition
which appeared for the first time in the eleventh century, and
which so pleased and charmed a degenerate age as to make of the
'Makamat' the most favorite reading. Ahmad Abu Fadl
al-Hamadh&aacute;n&iacute;, "the wonder of all time" (died 1007),
composed the first of such "sessions." Of his four hundred only a
few have come down to our time. Abu Muhammad al-Hariri (1030-1121),
of B&acirc;sra, is certainly the one who made this species of
literature popular; he has been closely imitated in Hebrew by
Char&iacute;zi (1218), and in Syriac by Ebed Y&eacute;shu (1290).
"Mak&aacute;mah" means the place where one stands, where assemblies
are held; then, the discourses delivered, or conversations held in
such an assembly. The word is used here especially to denote a
series of "discourses and conversations composed in a highly
finished and ornamental style, and solely for the purpose of
exhibiting various kinds of eloquence, and exemplifying the rules
of grammar, rhetoric, and poetry." Hariri himself speaks of--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"These 'Makamat,' which contain serious language and
lightsome,</p>
<p class="i4">And combine refinement with dignity of style,</p>
<p class="i4">And brilliancies with jewels of eloquence,</p>
<p class="i4">And beauties of literature with its rarities,</p>
<p>Besides quotations from the 'Qur'an,' wherewith I adorned
them,</p>
<p>And choice metaphors, and Arab proverbs that I interspersed,</p>
<p class="i3">And literary elegancies, and grammatical riddles,</p>
<p class="i3">And decisions upon ambiguous legal questions,</p>
<p class="i2">And original improvisations, and highly wrought
orations,</p>
<p class="i2">And plaintive discourses, as well as jocose
witticisms."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The design is thus purely literary. The fifty "sessions" of
Hariri, which are written in rhymed prose interspersed with poetry,
contain oratorical, poetical, moral, encomiastic, and satirical
discourses, which only the merest thread holds together. Each
Mak&aacute;mah is a unit, and has no necessary connection with that
which follows. The thread which so loosely binds them together is
the delineation of the character of Abu Zeid, the hero, in his own
words. He is one of those wandering minstrels and happy improvisers
whom the favor of princes had turned into poetizing beggars. In
each Mak&aacute;mah is related some ruse, by means of which Abu
Zeid, because of his wonderful gift of speech, either persuades or
forces those whom he meets to pay for his sustenance, and furnish
the means for his debauches. Not the least of those thus ensnared
is his great admirer, H&aacute;reth ibn Hamm&aacute;m, the narrator
of the whole, who is none other than Hariri. Wearied at last with
his life of travel, debauch, and deception, Abu Zeid retires to his
native city and becomes an ascetic, thus to atone in a measure for
his past sins. The whole might be called, not improperly, a tale, a
novel. But the intention of the poet is to show forth the richness
and variety of the Arabic language; and his own power over this
great mass brings the descriptive--one might almost say the
lexicographic--side too much to the front. A poem that can be read
either backward or forward, or which contains all the words in the
language beginning with a certain letter, may be a wonderful
mosaic, but is nothing more. The merit of Hariri lies just in this:
that working in such cramped quarters, with such intent and design
continually guiding his pen, he has often really done more. He has
produced rhymed prose and verses which are certainly elegant in
diction and elevated in tone.</p>
<p>Such tales as these, told as an exercise of linguistic
gymnastics, must not blind us to the presence of real tales, told
for their own sake. Arabic literature has been very prolific in
these. They lightened the graver subjects discussed in the
tent,--philosophy, religion, and grammar,--and they furnished
entertainment for the more boisterous assemblies in the
coffee-houses and around the bowl. For the Arab is an inveterate
story-teller; and in nearly all the prose that he writes, this
character of the "teller" shimmers clearly through the work of the
"writer." He is an elegant narrator. Not only does he intersperse
verses and lines more frequently than our own taste would license:
by nature, he easily falls into the half-hearted poetry of rhymed
prose, for which the rich assonances of his language predispose.
His own learning was further cultivated by his early contact with
Persian literature; through which the fable and the wisdom of India
spoken from the mouths of dumb animals reached him. In this more
frivolous form of inculcating wisdom, the Prophet scented danger to
his strait-laced demands: "men who bring sportive legends, to lead
astray from God's path without knowledge and to make a jest of it;
for such is shameful woe," is written in the thirty-first Surah. In
vain; for in hours of relaxation, such works as the 'Fables of
Bidpai' (translated from the Persian in 750 by 'Abd Allah ibn
Muk&aacute;ffah), the 'Ten Viziers,' the 'Seven Wise Masters,'
etc., proved to be food too palatable. Nor were the Arabs wanting
in their own peculiar 'Romances,' influenced only in some portions
of the setting by Persian ideas. Such were the 'Story of Saif ibn
dhi Y&aacute;zan,' the 'Tale of al-Zir,' the 'Romance of
D&aacute;lhmah,' and especially the 'Romance of Antar' and the
'Thousand Nights and A Night.' The last two romances are excellent
commentaries on Arab life, at its dawn and at its fullness, among
the roving chiefs of the desert and the homes of revelry in Bagdad.
As the rough-hewn poetry of Imr-al-Kais and Zuh&eacute;ir is a
clearer exponent of the real Arab mind, roving at its own
suggestion, than the more perfect and softer lines of a
Mutan&aacute;bbi, so is the 'Romance of Antar' the full expression
of real Arab hero-worship. And even in the cities of the Orient
to-day, the loungers in their cups can never weary of following the
exploits of this black son of the desert, who in his person unites
the great virtues of his people, magnanimity and bravery, with the
gift of poetic speech. Its tone is elevated; its coarseness has as
its origin the outspokenness of unvarnished man; it does not peep
through the thin veneer of licentious suggestiveness. It is never
trivial, even in its long and wearisome descriptions, in its
ever-recurring outbursts of love. Its language suits its thought:
choice and educated, and not descending--as in the 'Nights'--to the
common expressions of ordinary speech. In this it resembles the
'Makamat' of Hariri, though much less artificial and more
enjoyable. It is the Arabic romance of chivalry, and may not have
been without influence on the spread of the romance of
medi&aelig;val Europe. For though its central figure is a hero of
pre-Islamic times, it was put together by the learned philologian,
al-'Asm&aacute;i, in the days of Harun the Just, at the time when
Charlemagne was ruling in Europe.</p>
<p>There exist in Arabic literature very few romances of the length
of 'Antar.' Though the Arab delights to hear and to recount tales,
his tales are generally short and pithy. It is in this shorter form
that he delights to inculcate principles of morality and norms of
character. He is most adroit at repartee and at pungent replies. He
has a way of stating principles which delights while it instructs.
The anecdote is at home in the East: many a favor is gained, many a
punishment averted, by a quick answer and a felicitously turned
expression. Such anecdotes exist as popular traditions in very
large numbers; and he receives much consideration whose mind is
well stocked with them. Collections of anecdotes have been put to
writing from time to time. Those dealing with the early history of
the caliphate are among the best prose that the Arabs have
produced. For pure prose was never greatly cultivated. The
literature dealing with their own history, or with the geography
and culture of the nations with which they came in contact, is very
large, and as a record of facts is most important. Ibn
Hish&aacute;m (died 767), W&aacute;kidi (died 822), Tabari
(838-923), Masudi (died 957), Ibn Ath&iacute;r (died 1233), Ibn
Khald&uacute;n (died 1406), Makrisi (died 1442), Suy&uacute;ti
(died 1505), and Makk&aacute;ri (died 1631), are only a few of
those who have given us large and comprehensive histories.
Al-Bir&uacute;ni (died 1038), writer, mathematician, and traveler,
has left us an account of the India of his day which has earned for
him the title "Herodotus of India," though for careful observation
and faithful presentation he stands far above the writer with whose
name he is adorned. But nearly all of these historical writers are
mere chronologists, dry and wearisome to the general reader. It is
only in the Preface, or 'Exordium,' often the most elaborate part
of the whole book viewed from a rhetorical standpoint, that they
attempt to rise above mere incidents and strive after literary
form. Besides the regard in which anecdotes are held, it is
considered a mark of education to insert in one's speech as often
as possible a familiar saying, a proverb, a <i>bon mot</i>. These
are largely used in the moral addresses (Kh&uacute;tbah) made in
the mosque or elsewhere, addresses which take on also the form of
rhymed prose. A famous collection of such sayings is attributed to
'Ali, the fourth successor of Muhammad. In these the whole power of
the Arab for subtle distinctions in matters of wordly wisdom, and
the truly religious feeling of the East, are clearly
manifested.</p>
<p>The propensity of the Arab mind for the tale and the anecdote
has had a wider influence in shaping the religious and legal
development, of Muhammadanism than would appear at first sight. The
'Qur'an' might well suffice as a directive code for a small body of
men whose daily life was simple, and whose organization was of the
crudest kind. But even Muhammad in his own later days was called on
to supplement the written word by the spoken, to interpret such
parts of his "book" as were unintelligible, to reconcile
conflicting statements, and to fit the older legislation to changed
circumstances. As the religious head of the community, his dictum
became law; and these <i>logia</i> of the Prophet were handed
around and handed down as the unwritten law by which his
lieutenants were to be guided, in matters not only religious, but
also legal. For "law" to them was part and parcel of "religion."
This "hadith" grew apace, until, in the third century of the
H&iacute;jrah, it was put to writing. Nothing bears weight which
has not the stamp of Muhammad's authority, as reported by his near
surroundings and his friends. In such a mass of tradition, great
care is taken to separate the chaff from the wheat. The chain of
tradition (Isn&aacute;d) must be given for each tradition, for each
anecdote. But the "friends" of the Prophet are said to have
numbered seven thousand five hundred, and it has not been easy to
keep out fraud and deception. The subjects treated are most varied,
sometimes even trivial, but dealing usually with recondite
questions of law and morals. Three great collections of the
'Had&iacute;th' have been made: by al-Buch&aacute;ri (869),
M&uacute;slim (874), and al-Tirm&iacute;dhi (892). The first two
only are considered canonical. From these are derived the three
great systems of jurisprudence which to this day hold good in the
Muhammadan world.</p>
<p>The best presentation of the characteristics of Arabic poetry is
by W. Ahlwardt, 'Ueber Poesie und Poetik der Araber' (Gotha, 1856);
of Arabic metres, by G.W. Freytag, 'Darstellung der Arabischen
Verkunst' (Bonn, 1830). Translations of Arabic poetry have been
published by J.D. Carlyle, 'Specimens of Arabic Poetry' (Cambridge,
1796); W.A. Clouston, 'Arabic Poetry' (Glasgow, 1881); C.J. Lyall,
'Translations of Ancient Arabic Poetry' (London, 1885). The history
of Arabic literature is given in Th. N&ouml;ldeke's 'Beitr&auml;ge
zur Kenntniss der Poesie der Alten Araber' (Hanover, 1864), and F.
F. Arbuthnot's 'Arabic Authors' (London, 1890).</p>

<p>O friend, see the lightning there! it flickered and now is
gone,</p>
<p class="i1">as though flashed a pair of hands in the pillar of
crowned cloud.</p>
<p>Now, was it its blaze, or the lamps of a hermit that dwells
alone,</p>
<p class="i1">and pours o'er the twisted wicks the oil from his
slender cruse?</p>
<p>We sat there, my fellows and I, 'twixt D&aacute;rij and
al-Udhaib,</p>
<p class="i1">and gazed as the distance gloomed, and waited its
oncoming.</p>
<p>The right of its mighty rain advanced over Katan's ridge;</p>
<p class="i1">the left of its trailing skirt swept Yadhbul and
as-Sitar:</p>
<p>Then over Kutaifah's steep the flood of its onset drave,</p>
<p class="i1">and headlong before its storm the tall trees were
borne to ground;</p>
<p>And the drift of its waters passed o'er the crags of
al-Kan&acirc;n,</p>
<p class="i1">and drave forth the white-legged deer from the refuge
they sought therein.</p>
<p>And Taim&aacute;--it left not there the stem of a palm
aloft,</p>
<p class="i1">nor ever a tower, save ours, firm built on the living
rock.</p>
<p>And when first its misty shroud bore down upon Mount
Thab&icirc;r,</p>
<p class="i1">he stood like an ancient man in a gray-streaked
mantle wrapt.</p>
<p>The clouds cast their burdens down on the broad plain of
al-Ghabit,</p>
<p class="i1">as a trader from al-Yaman unfolds from the bales his
store;</p>
<p>And the topmost crest, on the morrow, of al-Mujaimir's
cairn,</p>
<p class="i1">was heaped with the flood-borne wrack, like wool on a
distaff wound.</p>

<p>Yea, and the place where his camp stood in ar-Rakmatan is

<p>The wild kine roam there large-eyed, and the deer pass to and

loveliness.</p>
<p>And the tassels of scarlet wool, in the spots where they gat
them down</p>
<p class="i1">glowed red, like to '<i>ishrik</i> seeds,
fresh-fallen, unbroken, bright.</p>
<p>And then they reached the wells where the deep-blue water
lies,</p>
<p class="i1">they cast down their staves, and set them to pitch
the tents for rest.</p>
<p>On their right hand rose al-Kan&acirc;n, and the rugged skirts
thereof--</p>
<p class="i1">(and in al-Kan&acirc;n how many are foes and friends
of mine!)</p>
<p>At eve they left as-S&ucirc;b&acirc;n; then they crossed the

of life!</p>
<p>I know what To-day unfolds, what before it was Yesterday;</p>
<p class="i1">but blind do I stand before the knowledge To-morrow
brings.</p>
<p>I have seen the Dooms trample men as a blind beast at random

on to strengthless eld.</p>
<p>Who gathers not friends by help, in many cases of need</p>

<p>And he who his honor shields by the doing of a kindly deed</p>
<p class="i1">grows richer; who shuts not the mouth of reviling, it
lights on him.</p>
<p>And he who is lord of wealth and niggardly with his hoard,</p>
<p class="i1">alone is he left by his kin; naught have they for him
but blame.</p>
<p>Who keeps faith, no blame he earns, and that man whose heart is
led</p>
<p class="i1">to goodness unmixed with guile gains freedom and

<p>Who spends on unworthy men his kindness with lavish hand;</p>

<p>Who will not yield to the spears, when their feet turn to him in
peace,</p>
<p class="i1">shall yield to the points thereof, and the long
flashing blades of steel.</p>
<p>Who holds not his foe away from his cistern with sword and

men.</p>
Who makes of his soul a beast of burden to bear men's loads,

be his lot.</p>
<p>Whatso be the shaping of mind that a man is born withal,</p>
<p class="i1">though he think it lies hid from men, it shall surely
one day be known.</p>
<p>How many a man seemed goodly to thee while he held his
peace,</p>

turned to speech.</p>

<p>From 'Umar ibn Rab&iacute;'a's 'Love Poems': Translation of W.

<blockquote>In the valley of Mohassib I beheld her where she

Caution bade me turn aside, but love forbade and fixed me
there.<br>
Was it sunlight? or the windows of a gleaming mosque at eve,<br>
Lighted up for festal worship? or was all my fancy's dream?<br>
Ah, those earrings! ah, that necklace! Naufel's daughter sure the
maid,<br>
Or of Hashim's princely lineage, and the Servant of the Sun!<br>
But a moment flashed the splendor, as the o'er-hasty handmaids
drew<br>
Round her with a jealous hand the jealous curtains of the tent.<br>
Speech nor greeting passed between us; but she saw me, and I
saw<br>
Face the loveliest of all faces, hands the fairest of all
hands.<br>
Daughter of a better earth, and nurtured by a brighter sky;<br>
Would I ne'er had seen thy beauty! Hope is fled, but love
remains.</blockquote>

<p>A eulogy of the valor and culture of the men of Ghass&acirc;n,
written in time of the poet's political exile from them:
Translation of C. J. Lyall.</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Leave me alone, O Umaimah--alone with my sleepless pain--</p>
<p class="i1">alone with the livelong night and the wearily
lingering stars;</p>
<p>It draws on its length of gloom; methinks it will never end,</p>
<p class="i1">nor ever the Star-herd lead his flock to their folds
of rest;--</p>
<p>Alone with a breast whose griefs, that roamed far afield by
day,</p>
<p class="i1">the darkness has brought all home: in legions they
throng around.</p>
<p>A favor I have with 'Amr, a favor his father bore</p>
<p class="i1">toward me of old; a grace that carried no scorpion
sting.</p>
<p>I swear (and my word is true--an oath that hath no reserve,</p>
<p class="i1">and naught in my heart is hid save fair thought of
him, my friend)--</p>
<p>If these twain his fathers were, who lie in their graves; the
one</p>
<p class="i1">al-Jillik, the others al-Said&acirc;, by
H&acirc;rib's side,</p>
<p>And H&acirc;rith, of Jafnah's line, the lord of his folk of
old--</p>
<p class="i1">yea, surely his might shall reach the home of his
enemy!</p>
<p>In him hope is sure of help when men say--"The host is sped,</p>
<p class="i1">the horsemen of Ghass&acirc;n's line unblemished, no
hireling herd,</p>
<p>His cousins, all near of kin, their chief 'Amr, '&Acirc;mir's
son--</p>
<p class="i1">a people are they whose might in battle shall never
fail!"</p>
<p>When goes forth the host to war, above them in circles wheel</p>
<p class="i1">battalions of eagles, pointing the path to battalions
more;</p>
<p>Their friendship is old and tried, fast comrades, in foray
bred</p>
<p class="i1">to look unafraid on blood, as hounds to the chase
well trained.</p>
<p>Behold them, how they sit there, behind where their armies
meet,</p>
<p class="i1">watching with eyes askance, like elders in gray furs
wrapt,</p>
<p>Intent; for they know full well that those whom they follow,
when</p>
<p class="i1">the clash of the hosts shall come, will bear off the
victory.</p>
<p>Ay, well is that custom known, a usage that time has proved</p>
<p class="i1">when lances are laid in rest on withers of steeds
arow--</p>
<p>Of steeds in the spear-play skilled, with lips for the fight
drawn back,</p>
<p class="i1">their bodies with wounds all scarred, some bleeding
and some half-healed.</p>
<p>And down leap the riders where the battle is strait and
stern,</p>
<p class="i1">and spring in the face of Death like stallions amid
the herd;</p>
<p>Between them they give and take deep draughts of the wine of
doom</p>
<p class="i1">as their hands ply the white swords, thin and keen in
the smiting-edge.</p>
<p>In shards fall the morions burst by the fury of blow on
blow,</p>
<p class="i1">and down to the eyebrows, cleft, fly shattered the
skulls beneath.</p>
<p>In them no defect is found, save only that in their swords</p>
<p class="i1">are notches, a many, gained from smiting of host on
host:</p>
<p>An heirloom of old, those blades, from the fight of
Hal&icirc;mah's day,</p>
<p class="i1">and many the mellay fierce that since has their
temper proved;</p>
<p>Therewith do they cleave in twain the hauberk of double
woof,</p>
<p class="i1">and kindle the rock beneath to fire, ere the stroke
is done.</p>
<p>A nature is theirs--God gives the like to no other men--</p>
<p class="i1">a wisdom that never sleeps, a bounty that never
fails.</p>
<p>Their home is God's own land, His chosen of old; their faith</p>
<p class="i1">is steadfast. Their hope is set on naught but the
world to come.</p>
<p>Their sandals are soft and fine, and girded with chastity,</p>
<p class="i1">they welcome with garlands sweet the dawn of the
Feast of Palms.</p>
<p>There greets them when they come home full many a handmaid
fine,</p>
<p class="i1">and ready, on trestles, hang the mantles of scarlet
silk.</p>
<p>Yea, softly they wrap their limbs, well-knowing of wealth and
ease,</p>
<p class="i1">in rich raiment, white-sleeved, green at the
shoulder--in royal guise.</p>
<p>They look not on Weal as men who know not that Woe comes,
too:</p>
<p class="i1">they look not on evil days as though they would never
mend.</p>

<h2><a name="FROM_THE_QU'RAN"></a>FROM THE QU'RAN</h2>
<center>Translation of George Sale</center>
<br>
<h3>CHAPTER XXXV.: INTITLED "THE CREATOR." REVEALED AT MECCA</h3>
<p>In the name of the most merciful GOD. Praise be unto GOD, the
creator of heaven and earth; who maketh the angels <i>his</i>
messengers, furnished with two, and three, and four <i>pair</i> of
wings: GOD maketh what addition he pleaseth unto <i>his</i>
creatures; for GOD <i>is</i> almighty. The mercy which GOD shall
freely bestow on mankind, <i>there is</i> none who can withhold;
and what he shall withhold, <i>there is</i> none who can bestow,
besides him: and he <i>is</i> the mighty, the wise. O men, remember
the favor of GOD towards you: is there any creator, besides GOD,
who provideth food for you from heaven and earth? <i>There is</i>
no GOD but he: how therefore are ye turned aside <i>from
acknowledging his unity?</i> If they accuse thee of imposture,
apostles before thee have also been accused of imposture; and unto
GOD shall <i>all</i> things return. O men, verily the promise of
GOD is true: let not therefore the present life deceive you,
neither let the deceiver deceive you concerning GOD: for Satan
<i>is</i> an enemy unto you; wherefore hold him for an enemy: he
only inviteth his confederates to be the inhabitants of hell. For
those who believe not <i>there is prepared</i> a severe torment:
but for those who shall believe and do that which is right, <i>is
prepared</i> mercy and a great reward. Shall he therefore for whom
his evil work hath been prepared, and who imagineth it to be good,
<i>be as he who is rightly disposed, and discerneth the truth</i>?
Verily GOD will cause to err whom he pleaseth, and will direct whom
he pleaseth. Let not thy soul therefore be spent in sighs for their
sakes, <i>on account of their obstinacy</i>; for GOD well knoweth
that which they do. <i>It is God</i> who sendeth the winds, and
raiseth a cloud: and we drive the same unto a dead country, and
thereby quicken the earth after it hath been dead; so <i>shall</i>
the resurrection <i>be</i>. Whoever desireth excellence; unto GOD
<i>doth</i> all excellence <i>belong</i>: unto him ascendeth the
good speech; and the righteous work will he exalt. But as for them
who devise wicked <i>plots</i>, they shall suffer a severe
punishment; and the device of those <i>men</i> shall be rendered
vain. GOD created you <i>first</i> of the dust, and afterwards of
seed: and he hath made you man and wife. No female conceiveth, or
bringeth forth, but with his knowledge. Nor is any thing added unto
the age of him whose life is prolonged, neither is any thing
diminished from his age, but <i>the same is written</i> in the book
<i>of God's decrees</i>. Verily this is easy with GOD. The two seas
are not to be held in comparison: this <i>is</i> fresh <i>and</i>
sweet, pleasant to drink; but that <i>is</i> salt <i>and</i>
bitter: yet out of each of them ye eat fish, and take ornaments for
you to wear. Thou seest the ships also ploughing <i>the waves</i>
thereof, that ye may seek <i>to enrich yourselves by commerce</i>,
of the abundance <i>of God</i>: peradventure ye will be thankful.
He causeth the night to succeed the day, and he causeth the day to
succeed the night; and he obligeth the sun and the moon to perform
their services: each <i>of them</i> runneth an appointed course.
This is GOD, your LORD: his <i>is</i> the kingdom. But the
<i>idols</i> which ye invoke besides him have not the power even
over the skin of a date-stone: if ye invoke them, they will not
hear your calling; and although they should hear, yet they would
not answer you. On the day of resurrection they shall disclaim your
having associated <i>them with God</i>: and none shall declare unto
thee <i>the truth</i>, like one who is well acquainted
<i>therewith</i>. O men, ye have need of GOD; but GOD is
self-sufficient, and to be praised. If he pleaseth, he can take you
away, and produce a new creature <i>in your stead</i>: neither
<i>will</i> this <i>be</i> difficult with GOD. A burdened
<i>soul</i> shall not bear the burden of another: and if a
heavy-burdened <i>soul</i> call <i>on another</i> to bear part of
its <i>burden</i>, no part thereof shall be borne <i>by the person
who shall be called on</i>, although he be <i>ever so nearly</i>
related. Thou shalt admonish those who fear their LORD in secret,
and are constant at prayer: and whoever cleanseth himself <i>from
the guilt of disobedience</i>, cleanseth himself to <i>the
advantage</i> of his own soul; for all shall be assembled before
GOD <i>at the last day</i>. The blind and the seeing shall not be
held equal; neither darkness and light; nor the cool shade and the
scorching wind: neither shall the living and the dead be held
equal. GOD shall cause him to hear whom he pleaseth: but thou shalt
not make those to hear who are in <i>their</i> graves. Thou
<i>art</i> no other than a preacher; verily we have sent thee with
truth, a bearer of good tidings, and a denouncer of threats.</p>
<p><i>There hath been</i> no nation, but a preacher hath in past
times been <i>conversant</i> among them: if they charge thee with
imposture, they who were before them likewise charged <i>their
apostles</i> with imposture. Their apostles came unto them with
evident <i>miracles</i>, and with <i>divine</i> writings, and with
the Enlightening Book: afterwards I chastised those who were
unbelievers; and how <i>severe</i> was my vengeance! Dost thou not
see that GOD sendeth down rain from heaven, and that we thereby
produce fruits of various colors? In the mountains also <i>there
are</i> some tracts white and red, of various colors; and <i>others
are</i> of a deep black: and of men, and beasts, and cattle
<i>there are</i> whose colors <i>are</i> in like manner various.
Such only of his servants fear GOD as are endued with
understanding: verily GOD <i>is</i> mighty <i>and</i> ready to
forgive. Verily they who read the book of GOD, and are constant at
prayer, and give alms out of what we have bestowed on them,
<i>both</i> in secret and openly, hope for a merchandise which
shall not perish: that <i>God</i> may fully pay them their wages,
and make them a <i>superabundant</i> addition of his liberality;
for he <i>is</i> ready to forgive <i>the faults of his servants,
and</i> to requite <i>their endeavors</i>. That which we have
revealed unto thee of the book <i>of the Kor&acirc;n</i> is the
truth, confirming the <i>scriptures</i> which <i>were revealed</i>
before it: for GOD knoweth <i>and</i> regardeth his servants. And
we have given the book <i>of the Kor&acirc;n</i> in heritage unto
such of our servants as we have chosen: of them <i>there is one</i>
who injureth his own soul; and <i>there is another</i> of them who
keepeth the middle way; and <i>there is another</i> of them who
outstrippeth <i>others</i> in good <i>works</i>, by the permission
of GOD. This is the great excellence. They shall be introduced into
gardens of perpetual abode; they shall be adorned therein with
bracelets of gold, and pearls, and their clothing therein <i>shall
be</i> of silk: and they shall say, Praise be unto GOD, who hath
taken away sorrow from us! verily our LORD <i>is</i> ready to
forgive <i>the sinners</i>, and to reward <i>the obedient</i>: who
hath caused us to take up our rest in a dwelling of <i>eternal</i>
stability, through his bounty, wherein no labor shall touch us,
neither shall any weariness affect us. But for the unbelievers
<i>is prepared</i> the fire of hell: it shall not be decreed them
to die <i>a second time</i>; neither shall <i>any part</i> of the
punishment thereof be made lighter unto them. Thus shall every
infidel be rewarded. And they shall cry out aloud in <i>hell,
saying,</i> LORD, take us hence, and we will work righteousness,
and not what we have <i>formerly</i> wrought. <i>But it shall be
answered them</i>, Did we not grant you lives of length sufficient,
that whoever would be warned might be warned therein; and did not
the preacher come unto you? Taste therefore <i>the pains of
hell</i>. And the unjust shall have no protector. Verily GOD
knoweth the secrets <i>both</i> of heaven and earth, for he knoweth
the innermost parts of the breasts <i>of men</i>. It is he who hath
made you to succeed in the earth. Whoever shall disbelieve, on him
<i>be</i> his unbelief; and their unbelief shall only gain the
unbelievers greater indignation in the sight of their LORD; and
their unbelief shall only increase the perdition of the
unbelievers. Say, what think ye of your deities which ye invoke
besides GOD? Show me what <i>part</i> of the earth they have
created. Or had they any share in <i>the creation of</i> the
heavens? Have we given unto <i>the idolaters</i> any book <i>of
revelations</i>, so that they <i>may rely</i> on any proof
therefrom <i>to authorize their practice?</i> Nay; but the ungodly
make unto one another only deceitful promises. Verily GOD
sustaineth the heavens and the earth, lest they fail: and if they
should fail, none could support the same besides him; he is
gracious <i>and</i> merciful. <i>The Koreish</i> swore by GOD, with
a most solemn oath, that if a preacher had come unto them, they
would surely have been more <i>willingly</i> directed than any
nation: but now a preacher is come unto them, it hath only
increased in them <i>their</i> aversion <i>from the truth,
their</i> arrogance in the earth, and <i>their</i> contriving of
evil; but the contrivance of evil shall only encompass the authors
thereof. Do they expect any other than the punishment awarded
against the <i>unbelievers</i> of former times? For thou shalt not
find any change in the ordinance of GOD; neither shalt thou find
any variation in the ordinance of GOD. Have they not gone through
the earth, and seen what hath been the end of those who were before
them; although they were more mighty in strength than they? GOD is
not to be frustrated by anything either in heaven or on earth; for
he is wise <i>and</i> powerful. If GOD should punish men according
to what they deserve, he would not leave on the back of <i>the
earth</i> so much as a beast; but he respiteth them to a determined
time; and when their time shall come, verily GOD will regard his
servants.</p>

</a>CHAPTER LV.: INTITLED "THE MERCIFUL." REVEALED AT MECCA</h3>
<p>In the name of the most merciful GOD. The Merciful hath taught
<i>his servant</i> the Kor&acirc;n. He created man: he hath taught
him distinct speech. The sun and the moon <i>run their courses</i>
according to a certain rule: and the vegetables which creep on the
ground, and the trees submit <i>to his disposition</i>. He also
raised the heaven; and he appointed the balance, that ye should not
transgress in respect to the balance: wherefore observe a just
weight; and diminish not the balance. And the earth hath he
prepared for living creatures: therein <i>are various</i> fruits,
and palm-trees bearing sheaths of flowers; and grain having chaff,
and leaves. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye
ungratefully deny? He created man of dried clay like an earthen
vessel: but he created the genii of fire clear from smoke. Which,
therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? <i>He
is</i> the LORD of the east, and the LORD of the west. Which,
therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? He
hath let loose the two seas, that they meet each another: between
them <i>is placed</i> a bar which they cannot pass. Which,
therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? From
them are taken forth unions and lesser pearls. Which, therefore, of
your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? His also <i>are</i>
the ships, carrying their sails aloft in the sea like mountains.
Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully
deny? Every <i>creature</i> which <i>liveth</i> on <i>the earth
is</i> subject to decay: but the glorious and honorable countenance
of thy LORD shall remain <i>for ever</i>. Which, therefore, of your
LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? Unto him do all
<i>creatures</i> which <i>are</i> in heaven and earth make
petition; every day <i>is</i> he <i>employed</i> in <i>some new</i>
work. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye
ungratefully deny? We will surely attend to <i>judge</i> you, O men
and genii, <i>at the last day</i>. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S
benefits will ye ungratefully deny? O ye collective body of genii
and men, if ye be able to pass out of the confines of heaven and
earth, pass forth: ye shall not pass forth but by absolute power.
Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully
deny? A flame of fire without smoke, and a smoke without flame
shall be sent down upon you; and ye shall not be able to defend
yourselves <i>therefrom</i>. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S
benefits will ye ungratefully deny? And when the heaven shall be
rent in sunder, and shall become <i>red as</i> a rose, <i>and shall
melt</i> like ointment: (Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits
will ye ungratefully deny?) On that day neither man nor genius
shall be asked concerning his sin. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S
benefits will ye ungratefully deny? The wicked shall be known by
their marks; and they shall be taken by the forelocks, and the
feet, <i>and shall be cast into hell</i>. Which, therefore, of your
LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? This <i>is</i> hell
which the wicked deny as a falsehood: they shall pass to and fro
between the same and hot boiling water. Which, therefore, of your
LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? But for him who dreadeth
the tribunal of his LORD <i>are prepared</i> two gardens: (Which,
therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny?) In
each of them <i>shall be</i> two fountains flowing. Which,
therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? In
each of them <i>shall there be</i> of every fruit two kinds. Which,
therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? They
shall repose on couches, the linings whereof <i>shall be</i> of
thick silk interwoven with gold; and the fruit of the two gardens
<i>shall be</i> near at hand <i>to gather</i>. Which, therefore, of
your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? Therein <i>shall
receive them beauteous damsels</i>, refraining their eyes <i>from
beholding any besides their spouses</i>: whom no man shall have
deflowered before them, neither any Jinn: (Which, therefore, of
your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny?) <i>Having
complexions</i> like rubies and pearls. Which, therefore, of your
LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? <i>Shall</i> the reward
of good works <i>be</i> any other good? Which, therefore, of your
LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? And besides these there
<i>shall be</i> two <i>other</i> gardens: (Which, therefore, of
your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny?) Of a dark green.
Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully
deny? In each of them <i>shall be</i> two fountains pouring forth
plenty of water. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye
ungratefully deny? In each of them <i>shall be</i> fruits, and
palm-trees, and pomegranates. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S
benefits will ye ungratefully deny? Therein <i>shall be</i>
agreeable and beauteous <i>damsels</i>: Which, therefore, of your
LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully deny? Whom no man shall have
deflowered before <i>their destined spouses</i>, nor any Jinn.
Which, therefore, of your LORD'S benefits will ye ungratefully
deny? <i>Therein shall they delight themselves</i>, lying on green
cushions and beautiful carpets. Which, therefore, of your LORD'S
benefits will ye ungratefully deny? Blessed be the name of thy
LORD, possessed of glory and honor!</p>

<h3>CHAPTER LXXXIV.: INTITLED "<a name=
"THE_RENDING_IN_SUNDER"></a>THE RENDING IN SUNDER." REVEALED AT
MECCA</h3>
<p>In the name of the most merciful GOD. When the heaven shall be
rent in sunder, and shall obey its LORD, and shall be capable
<i>thereof</i>; and when the earth shall be stretched out, and
shall cast forth that which <i>is</i> therein, and shall remain
empty, and shall obey its LORD, and shall be capable
<i>thereof</i>: O man, verily laboring thou laborest to <i>meet</i>
thy LORD, and thou shalt meet him. And he who shall have his book
given into his right hand shall be called to an easy account, and
shall turn unto his family with joy: but he who shall have his book
given him behind his back shall invoke destruction <i>to fall upon
him</i>, and he shall be sent into hell to be burned; because he
rejoiced insolently amidst his family <i>on earth</i>. Verily he
thought he should never return <i>unto God</i>: yea verily, but his
LORD beheld him. Wherefore I swear by the redness of the sky after
sunset, and by the night, and the <i>animals</i> which it driveth
together, and by the moon when she is in the full; ye shall surely
be transferred <i>successively</i> from state to state. What
<i>aileth</i> them, therefore, that they believe not <i>the
resurrection</i>; and that, when the Kor&acirc;n is read unto them,
they worship not? Yea: the unbelievers accuse <i>the same</i> of
imposture: but GOD well knoweth the <i>malice</i> which they keep
hidden <i>in their breasts</i>. Wherefore denounce unto them a
grievous punishment, except those who believe and do good works:
for them <i>is prepared</i> a never-failing reward.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>From the 'Makamat' of al-Hariri of Barra: Translation of
Theodore Preston</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>On a night whose aspect displayed both light and shade,</p>
<p>And whose moon was like a magic circlet of silver,</p>
<p>I was engaged in evening conversation at Koufa</p>
<p>With companions who had been nourished on the milk of
eloquence,</p>
<p>So the charms of conversation fascinated us,</p>
<p>While wakefulness still prevailed among us,</p>
<p>Until the moon had at length disappeared in the West.</p>
<p>But when the gloom of night had thus drawn its curtain,</p>
<p>And nothing but slumber remained abroad,</p>
<p>We heard from the door the low call of a benighted traveler,</p>
<p>And then followed the knock of one seeking admission;</p>
<p>And we answered, "Who comes here this darksome night?"</p>
<p>And the stranger replied:--</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">"Listen ye who here are dwelling!</p>
<p class="i6">May you so be kept from ill!</p>
<p class="i5">So may mischief ne'er befall you,</p>
<p class="i6">Long as life your breast shall fill!</p>
<p class="i5">Gloom of dismal night and dreary</p>
<p class="i6">Drives a wretch to seek your door,</p>
<p class="i5">Whose disheveled hoary tresses</p>
<p class="i6">All with dust are sprinkled o'er;</p>
<p class="i5">Who, though destitute and lonely,</p>
<p class="i6">Far has roamed on hill and dale,</p>
<p class="i5">Till his form became thus crooked,</p>
<p class="i6">And his cheek thus deadly pale;</p>
<p class="i5">Who, though faint as slender crescent,</p>
<p class="i6">Ventures here for aid to sue,</p>
<p class="i5">Hospitable meal and shelter</p>
<p class="i6">Claiming first of all from you.</p>
<p class="i5">Welcome then to food and dwelling</p>
<p class="i6">One so worthy both to share,</p>
<p class="i5">Sure to prove content and thankful,</p>
<p class="i6">Sure to laud your friendly care."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Fascinated then by the sweetness of his language and
delivery,</p>
<p>And readily inferring what this prelude betokened,</p>
<p>We hasted to open the door, and received him with welcome,</p>
<p>Saying to the servant, "Hie! Hie! Bring whatever is ready!"</p>
<p>But the stranger said, "By Him who brought me to your abode,</p>
<p>I will not taste of your hospitality, unless you pledge to
me</p>
<p>That you will not permit me to be an incumbrance to you,</p>
<p>Nor impose on yourselves necessity of eating on my account."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<hr style="width: 25%;"></div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Now it was just as if he had been informed of our wishes,</p>
<p>Or had shot from the same bow as our sentiments;</p>
<p>So we gratified him by acceding to the condition,</p>
<p>And highly commended him for his accommodating disposition.</p>
<p>But when the servant had produced what was ready,</p>
<p>And the candle was lighted up in the midst of us,</p>
<p>I regarded him attentively, and lo! it was Abu-Zeid;</p>
<p>Whereupon I addressed my companions in these words:--</p>
<p>"May you have joy of the guest who has repaired to you:</p>
<p class="i2">For though the moon of the heavens has set,</p>
<p class="i2">The full moon of poetry has arisen;</p>
<p class="i2">And though the moon of the eclipse has
disappeared,</p>
<p class="i2">The full moon of eloquence has shone forth."</p>
<p class="i2">So the wine of joy infused itself into them,</p>
<p class="i2">And sleep flew away from the corners of their
eyes,</p>
<p>And they rejected the slumber which they had contemplated,</p>
<p>And began to resume the pleasantry which they had laid
aside,</p>
<p>While Abu-Zeid remained intent on the business in hand.</p>
<p>But as soon as he desired the removal of what was before
him,</p>
<p>I said to him, "Entertain us with one of thy strange
anecdotes,</p>
<p>Or with an account of one of thy wonderful journeys."</p>
<p>And he said:--"The result of long journeys brought me to this
land,</p>
<p>Myself being in a state of hunger and distress,</p>
<p>And my wallet light as the heart of the mother of Moses;</p>
<p>So I arose, when dark night had settled on the world,</p>
<p>Though with weary feet, to seek a lodging, or obtain a loaf;</p>
<p>Till, being driven on by the instigation of hunger,</p>
<p>And by fate, so justly called 'the parent of adventures,'</p>
<p>I stood at the door of a house and improvised these words:--</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">"'Inmates of this abode, all hail! all hail!</p>
<p class="i3">Long may you live in plenty's verdant vale.</p>
<p class="i3">Oh, grant your aid to one by toil opprest,</p>
<p class="i3">Way-worn, benighted, destitute, distrest;</p>
<p class="i3">Whose tortured entrails only hunger hold</p>
<p class="i3">(For since he tasted food two days are told);</p>
<p class="i3">A wretch who finds not where to lay his head,</p>
<p class="i3">Though brooding night her weary wing hath spread,</p>
<p class="i3">But roams in anxious hope a friend to meet,</p>
<p class="i3">Whose bounty, like a spring of water sweet,</p>
<p class="i3">May heal his woes; a friend who straight will
say,</p>
<p class="i3">"Come in! 'Tis time thy staff aside to lay."'</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"But there came out to me a boy in a short tunic, who
said:--</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i3">"'By Him who hospitable rites ordained,</p>
<p class="i3">And first of all, and best, those rites
maintained,</p>
<p class="i3">I swear that friendly converse and a home</p>
<p class="i3">Is all we have for those who nightly roam."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"And I replied, 'What can I do with an empty house,</p>
<p>And a host who is himself thus utterly destitute?</p>
<p>But what is thy name, boy? for thy intelligence charms me.'</p>
<p>He replied, 'My name is Zeid, and I was reared at Faid;</p>
<p>And my mother Barrah (who is such as her name implies),</p>
<p>Told me she married one of the nobles of Serong and
Ghass&acirc;n,</p>
<p>Who deserted her stealthily, and there was an end of him.'</p>
<p>Now I knew by these distinct signs that he was my child,</p>
<p>But my poverty deterred me from discovering myself to him."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then we asked if he wished to take his son to live with him;</p>
<p>And he replied, "If only my purse were heavy enough,</p>
<p>It would be easy for me to undertake the charge of him."</p>
<p>So we severally undertook to contribute a portion of it,</p>
<p>Whereupon he returned thanks for this our bounty,</p>
<p>And was so profusely lavish in his acknowledgments,</p>
<p>That we thought his expression of gratitude excessive.</p>
<p>And as soon as he had collected the coin into his scrip,</p>
<p>He looked at me as the deceiver looks at the deceived,</p>
<p>And laughed heartily, and then indited these lines:--</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">"O thou who, deceived</p>
<p class="i6">By a tale, hast believed</p>
<p class="i4">A mirage to be truly a lake,</p>

<p class="i6">My fraud undetected,</p>
<p class="i4">Or doubtful my meaning to make!</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">I confess that I lied</p>
<p class="i6">When I said that my bride</p>
<p class="i4">And my first-born were Barrah and Zeid;</p>
<p class="i6">But guile is my part,</p>
<p class="i6">And deception my art,</p>
<p class="i4">And by these are my gains ever made.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Such schemes I devise</p>
<p class="i6">That the cunning and wise</p>
<p class="i4">Never practiced the like or conceived;</p>
<p class="i6">Nor Asmai nor Komait</p>
<p class="i6">Any wonders relate</p>
<p class="i4">Like those that my wiles have achieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">But if these I disdain,</p>
<p class="i6">I abandon my gain,</p>
<p class="i4">And by fortune at once am refused:</p>
<p class="i6">Then pardon their use,</p>
<p class="i6">And accept my excuse,</p>
<p class="i4">Nor of guilt let my guile be accused."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Then he took leave of me, and went away from me,</p>

<h2><a name="THE_CALIPH_OMAR_BIN_ABD_AL-AZIZ_AND_THE_POETS"></a>THE
CALIPH OMAR BIN ABD AL-AZIZ AND THE POETS</h2>
<p>A Semi-Poetical Tale: Translation of Sir Richard Burton, in
'Supplemental Nights to the Book of The Thousand Nights and A
Night'</p>
<p>It is said that when the Caliphate devolved on Omar bin Abd
al-Aziz, (of whom Allah accept!) the poets resorted to him, as they
had been used to resort to the Caliphs before him, and abode at his
door days and days; but he suffered them not to enter till there
came to him 'Adi bin Artah, who stood high in esteem with him.
Jarir [another poet] accosted him, and begged him to crave
admission for them to the presence; so 'Adi answered, "'Tis well,"
and going in to Omar, said to him, "The poets are at thy door, and
have been there days and days; yet hast thou not given them leave
to enter, albeit their sayings abide, and their arrows from the
mark never fly wide." Quoth Omar, "What have I to do with the
poets?" And quoth 'Adi, "O Commander of the Faithful, the Prophet
(<i>Abhak!</i>) was praised by a poet, and gave him largesse--and
in him is an exemplar to every Moslem." Quoth Omar, "And who
praised him?" And quoth 'Adi, "Abb&aacute;s bin Mird&aacute;s
praised him, and he clad him with a suit and said, 'O Generosity!
Cut off from me his tongue!'" Asked the Caliph, "Dost thou remember
what he said?" And 'Adi answered, "Yes." Rejoined Omar, "Then
repeat it;" so 'Adi repeated:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>"I saw thee, O thou best of the human race,</p>
<p class="i5">Bring out a book which brought to graceless,
grace.</p>
<p>Thou showedst righteous road to men astray</p>
<p class="i5">From right, when darkest wrong had ta'en its
place:--</p>
<p>Thou with Isl&acirc;m didst light the gloomiest way,</p>
<p class="i5">Quenching with proof live coals of frowardness:</p>
<p>I own for Prophet, my Mohammed's self,</p>
<p class="i5">and men's award upon his word we base.</p>
<p>Thou madest straight the path that crooked ran</p>
<p class="i5">Where in old days foul growth o'ergrew its face.</p>
<p>Exalt be thou in Joy's empyrean!</p>
<p class="i5">And Allah's glory ever grow apace!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"And indeed," continued 'Adi, "this Elegy on the Prophet
(<i>Abhak!</i>) is well known, and to comment on it would be
tedious."</p>
<p>Quoth Omar, "Who [of the poets] is at the door?" And quoth 'Adi,
"Among them is Omar ibn Rab&iacute;'ah, the Korashi;" whereupon the
Caliph cried, "May Allah show him no favor, neither quicken him!
Was it not he who spoke impiously [in praising his love]?--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Could I in my clay-bed [the grave] with Ialma repose,</p>
<p class="i5">There to me were better than Heaven or Hell!'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Had he not [continued the Caliph] been the enemy of Allah, he
had wished for her in this world; so that he might, after, repent
and return to righteous dealing. By Allah! he shall not come in to
me! Who is at the door other than he?"</p>
<p>Quoth 'Adi, "Jamil bin Ma'mar al-Uzri is at the door." And quoth
Omar, "'Tis he who saith in one of his love-Elegies:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Would Heaven, conjoint we lived! and if I die,</p>
<p class="i5">Death only grant me a grave within her grave!</p>
<p>For I'd no longer deign to live my life</p>
<p class="i5">If told, "Upon her head is laid the pave."'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Quoth Omar, "Away with him from me! Who is at the door?" And
quoth 'Adi, "Kutthayir 'Azzah": whereupon Omar cried, "'Tis he who
saith in one of his [impious] Odes:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Some talk of faith and creed and nothing else,</p>
<p class="i5">And wait for pains of Hell in prayer-seat;</p>

<p>Leave the mention of <i>him</i>. Who is at the door?" Quoth
'Adi, "Al-Ahwas al-Ansari." Cried Omar, "Allah Almighty put him
away, and estrange him from His mercy! Is it not he who said,
berhyming on a Medinite's slave girl, so that she might outlive her
master:--</p>
<div class="poem">

<p>Allah be judge betwixt me and her lord</p>
<p class="i5">Whoever flies with her--and I pursue.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He shall not come in to me! Who is at the door other than he?"
'Adi replied, "Hammam bin Ghalib al-Farazdak." And Omar said, "Tis
he who glories in wickedness.... He shall not come in to me! Who is
at the door other than he?" 'Adi replied, "Al-Akhtal al-Taghlibi."
And Omar said, "He is the [godless] miscreant who saith in his
singing:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Ramazan I ne'er fasted in lifetime; nay</p>
<p class="i5">I ate flesh in public at undurn day!</p>
<p>Nor chid I the fair, save in word of love.</p>
<p class="i5">Nor seek Meccah's plain in salvation-way:</p>
<p>Nor stand I praying, like rest, who cry,</p>
<p class="i5">"Hie salvation-wards!" at the dawn's first

</div>
</div>
<p>By Allah! he treadeth no carpet of mine. Who is at the door
other than he?" Said 'Adi, "Jarir Ibn al-Khatafah." And Omar cried,
"Tis he who saith:--</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>'But for ill-spying glances, had our eyes espied</p>
<p class="i5">Eyes of the antelope, and ringlets of the Reems!</p>

<p class="i5">cried, "Turn in peace! No time for visit this,
meseems."'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But if it must be, and no help, admit Jarir." So 'Adi went forth
and admitted Jarir, who entered saying:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'Yea, He who sent Mohammed unto men.</p>
<p class="i5">A just successor of Islam assigned.</p>
<p>His ruth and his justice all mankind embrace.</p>
<p class="i5">To daunt the bad and stablish well-designed.</p>
<p>Verily now, I look to present good,</p>
<p class="i5">for man hath ever transient weal in mind.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Quoth Omar, "O Jarir! keep the fear of Allah before thine eyes,
and say naught save the sooth." And Jarir recited these
couplets:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>'How many widows loose the hair, in far Yamamah land,</p>
<p class="i1">How many an orphan there abides, feeble of voice and
eye,</p>
<p>Since faredst thou, who wast to them instead of father lost</p>
<p class="i1">when they like nestled fledglings were, sans power to

<p class="i1">Hope from the Caliph's grace to gain a rain that

</div>
</div>
<p>When the Caliph heard this, he said, "By Allah, O Jarir! Omar
possesseth but an hundred dirhams. Ho boy! do thou give them to
him!" Moreover, he gifted Jarir with the ornaments of his sword;
and Jarir went forth to the other poets, who asked him, "What is
behind thee?" ["What is thy news?"] and he answered, "A man who
giveth to the poor, and who denieth the poets; and with him I am
well pleased."</p>

<h2><a name="DOMINIQUE_FRANCOIS_ARAGO"></a>DOMINIQUE
FRAN&Ccedil;OIS ARAGO</h2>
<h3>(1786-1853)</h3>
<h3>BY EDWARD S. HOLDEN</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-d.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ominique Fran&ccedil;ois Arago was born February 26th, 1786,
near Perpignan, in the Eastern Pyrenees, where his father held the
position of Treasurer of the Mint. He entered the &Eacute;cole
Polytechnique in Paris after a brilliant examination, and held the
first places throughout the course. In 1806 he was sent to Valencia
in Spain, and to the neighboring island of Iviza, to make the
astronomical observations for prolonging the arc of the meridian
from Dunkirk southward, in order to supply the basis for the metric
system.</p>
<a name="illus0704.jpg"></a><br>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illus0704.jpg" width="50%" alt=
""></p>
<br>
<p>Here begin his extraordinary adventures, which are told with
inimitable spirit and vigor in his 'Autobiography.' Arago's work
required him to occupy stations on the summits of the highest peaks
in the mountains of southeastern Spain. The peasants were densely
ignorant and hostile to all foreigners, so that an escort of troops
was required in many of his journeys. At some stations he made
friends of the bandits of the neighborhood, and carried on his
observations under their protection, as it were. In 1807 the
tribunal of the Inquisition existed in Valencia; and Arago was
witness to the trial and punishment of a pretended sorceress,--and
this, as he says, in one of the principal towns of Spain, the seat
of a celebrated university. Yet the worst criminals lived
unmolested in the cathedrals, for the "right of asylum" was still
in force. His geodetic observations were mysteries to the
inhabitants, and his signals on the mountain top were believed to
be part of the work of a French spy. Just at this time hostilities
broke out between France and Spain, and the astronomer was obliged
to flee disguised as a Majorcan peasant, carrying his precious
papers with him. His knowledge of the Majorcan language saved him,
and he reached a Spanish prison with only a slight wound from a
dagger. It is the first recorded instance, he says, of a fugitive
flying to a dungeon for safety. In this prison, under the care of
Spanish officers, Arago found sufficient occupation in calculating
observations which he had made; in reading the accounts in the
Spanish journals of his own execution at Valencia; and in listening
to rumors that it was proposed (by a Spanish monk) to do away with
the French prisoner by poisoning his food.</p>
<p>The Spanish officer in charge of the prisoners was induced to
connive at the escape of Arago and M. Berth&eacute;mie (an
aide-de-camp of Napoleon); and on the 28th of July, 1808, they
stole away from the coast of Spain in a small boat with three
sailors, and arrived at Algiers on the 3d of August. Here the
French consul procured them two false passports, which transformed
the Frenchmen into strolling merchants from Schwekat and Leoben.
They boarded an Algerian vessel and set off. Let Arago describe the
crew and cargo:--</p>
<p>"The vessel belonged to the Emir of Seca. The commander was a
Greek captain named Spiro Calligero. Among the passengers were five
members of the family superseded by the Bakri as kings of the Jews;
two Maroccan ostrich-feather merchants; Captain Krog from Bergen in
Norway; two lions sent by the Dey of Algiers as presents to the
Emperor Napoleon; and a great number of monkeys."</p>
<p>As they entered the Golfe du Lion their ship was captured by a
Spanish corsair and taken to Rosas. Worst of all, a former Spanish
servant of Arago's--Pablo--was a sailor in the corsair's crew! At
Rosas the prisoners were brought before an officer for
interrogation. It was now Arago's turn. The officer begins:--</p>
<p>"'Who are you?'</p>
<p>"'A poor traveling merchant.'</p>
<p>"'From whence do you come?'</p>
<p>"'From a country where you certainly have never been.'</p>
<p>"'Well--from what country?'</p>
<p>"I feared to answer; for the passports (steeped in vinegar to
prevent infection) were in the officer's hands, and I had entirely
forgotten whether I was from Schwekat or from Leoben. Finally I
answered at a chance, 'I am from Schwekat;' fortunately this answer
agreed with the passport.</p>
<p>"'You're from Schwekat about as much as I am,' said the officer:
'you're a Spaniard, and a Spaniard from Valencia to boot, as I can
tell by your accent.'</p>
<p>"'Sir, you are inclined to punish me simply because I have by
nature the gift of languages. I readily learn the dialects of the
various countries where I carry on my trade. For example, I know
the dialect of Iviza.'</p>
<p>"'Well, I will take you at your word. Here is a soldier who
comes from Iviza. Talk to him.'</p>
<p>"'Very well; I will even sing the goat-song.'</p>
<p>"The verses of this song (if one may call them verses) are
separated by the imitated bleatings of the goat. I began at once,
with an audacity which even now astonishes me, to intone the song
which all the shepherds in Iviza sing:--</p>
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i5">Ah graciada Se&ntilde;ora,</p>
<p class="i5">Una canzo bouil canta,</p>
<p class="i6">B&egrave; b&egrave; b&egrave; b&egrave;.</p>
<p class="i5">No sera gaiva pulida,</p>
<p class="i5">Nos&eacute; si vos agradara,</p>
<p class="i6">B&egrave; b&egrave; b&egrave; b&egrave;.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Upon which my Ivizan avouches, in tears, that I am certainly
from Iviza. The song had affected him as a Switzer is affected by
the 'Ranz des Vaches.' I then said to the officer that if he would
bring to me a person who could speak French, he would find the same
embarrassment in this case also. An emigr&eacute; of the Bourbon
regiment comes forward for the new experiment, and after a few
phrases affirms without hesitation that I am surely a Frenchman.
The officer begins to be impatient.</p>
<p>"'Have done with these trials: they prove nothing. I require you
to tell me who you are.'</p>
<p>"'My foremost desire is to find an answer which will satisfy
you. I am the son of the innkeeper at Mataro.'</p>
<p>"'I know that man: you are not his son.'</p>
<p>"'You are right: I told you that I should change my answers till
I found one to suit you. I am a marionette player from Lerida.'</p>
<p>"A huge laugh from the crowd which had listened to the
interrogatory put an end to the questioning."</p>
<p>Finally it was necessary for Arago to declare outright that he
was French, and to prove it by his old servant Pablo. To supply his
immediate wants he sold his watch; and by a series of misadventures
this watch subsequently fell into the hands of his family, and he
was mourned in France as dead.</p>
<p>After months of captivity the vessel was released, and the
prisoner set out for Marseilles. A fearful tempest drove them to
the harbor of Bougie, an African port a hundred miles east of
Algiers. Thence they made the perilous journey by land to their
place of starting, and finally reached Marseilles eleven months
after their voyage began. Eleven months to make a journey of four
days!</p>
<p>The intelligence of the safe arrival, after so many perils, of
the young astronomer, with his packet of precious observations,
soon reached Paris. He was welcomed with effusion. Soon afterward
(at the age of twenty-three years) he was elected a member of the
section of Astronomy of the Academy of Sciences, and from this time
forth he led the peaceful life of a savant. He was the Director of
the Paris Observatory for many years; the friend of all European
scientists; the ardent patron of young men of talent; a leading
physicist; a strong Republican, though the friend of Napoleon; and
finally the Perpetual Secretary of the Academy.</p>
<p>In the latter capacity it was part of his duty to prepare
<i>&eacute;loges</i> of deceased Academicians. Of his collected
works in fourteen volumes, 'Oeuvres de Fran&ccedil;ois Arago,'
published in Paris, 1865, three volumes are given to these 'Notices
Biographiques.' Here may be found the biographies of Bailly, Sir
William Herschel, Laplace, Joseph Fourier, Carnot, Malus, Fresnel,
Thomas Young, and James Watt; which, translated rather carelessly
into English, have been published under the title 'Biographies of
Distinguished Men,' and can be found in the larger libraries. The
collected works contain biographies also of Amp&egrave;re,
Condoreet, Volta, Monge, Porson, Gay-Lussac, besides shorter
sketches. They are masterpieces of style and of clear scientific
exposition, and full of generous appreciation of others' work. They
present in a lucid and popular form the achievements of scientific
men whose works have changed the accepted opinion of the world, and
they give general views not found in the original writings
themselves. Scientific men are usually too much engrossed in
advancing science to spare time for expounding it to popular
audiences. The talent for such exposition is itself a special one.
Arago possessed it to the full, and his own original contributions
to astronomy and physics enabled him to speak as an expert, not
merely as an expositor.</p>
<p>The extracts are from his admirable estimate of Laplace, which
he prepared in connection with the proposal, before him and other
members of a State Committee, to publish a new and authoritative
edition of the great astronomer's works. The translation is mainly
that of the 'Biographies of Distinguished Men' cited above, and
much of the felicity of style is necessarily lost in translation;
but the substance of solid and lucid exposition from a master's
hand remains.</p>
<p>Arago was a Deputy in 1830, and Minister of War in the
Provisional Government of 1848. He died full of honors, October 2d,
1853. Two of his brothers, Jacques and &Eacute;tienne, were
dramatic authors of note. Another, Jean, was a distinguished
general in the service of Mexico. One of his sons, Alfred, is
favorably known as a painter; another, Emmanuel, as a lawyer,
deputy, and diplomat.</p>

<h2><a name="LAPLACE"></a>LAPLACE</h2>
<p>The Marquis de Laplace, peer of France, one of the forty of the
French Academy, member of the Academy of Sciences and of the Bureau
of Longitude, Associate of all the great Academies or Scientific
Societies of Europe, was born at Beaumont-en-Auge, of parents
belonging to the class of small farmers, on the 28th of March,
1749; he died on the 5th of March, 1827. The first and second
volumes of the 'M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste' [Mechanism of the
Heavens] were published in 1799; the third volume appeared in 1802,
the fourth in 1805; part of the fifth volume was published in 1823,
further books in 1824, and the remainder in 1825. The
'Th&eacute;orie des Probabilit&eacute;s' was published in 1812. We
shall now present the history of the principal astronomical
discoveries contained in these immortal works.</p>
<p>Astronomy is the science of which the human mind may justly feel
proudest. It owes this pre-eminence to the elevated nature of its
object; to the enormous scale of its operations; to the certainty,
the utility, and the stupendousness of its results. From the very
beginnings of civilization the study of the heavenly bodies and
their movements has attracted the attention of governments and
peoples. The greatest captains, statesmen, philosophers, and
orators of Greece and Rome found it a subject of delight. Yet
astronomy worthy of the name is a modern science: it dates from the
sixteenth century only. Three great, three brilliant phases have
marked its progress. In 1543 the bold and firm hand of Copernicus
overthrew the greater part of the venerable scaffolding which had
propped the illusions and the pride of many generations. The earth
ceased to be the centre, the pivot, of celestial movements.
Henceforward it ranged itself modestly among the other planets, its
relative importance as one member of the solar system reduced
almost to that of a grain of sand.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight years had elapsed from the day when the Canon of
Thorn expired while holding in his trembling hands the first copy
of the work which was to glorify the name of Poland, when
W&uuml;rtemberg witnessed the birth of a man who was destined to
achieve a revolution in science not less fertile in consequences,
and still more difficult to accomplish. This man was Kepler.
Endowed with two qualities which seem incompatible,--a volcanic
imagination, and a dogged pertinacity which the most tedious
calculations could not tire,--Kepler conjectured that celestial
movements must be connected with each other by simple laws; or, to
use his own expression, by harmonic laws. These laws he undertook
to discover. A thousand fruitless attempts--the errors of
calculation inseparable from a colossal undertaking--did not hinder
his resolute advance toward the goal his imagination descried.
Twenty-two years he devoted to it, and still he was not weary. What
are twenty-two years of labor to him who is about to become the
lawgiver of worlds; whose name is to be ineffaceably inscribed on
the frontispiece of an immortal code; who can exclaim in
dithyrambic language, "The die is cast: I have written my book; it
will be read either in the present age or by posterity, it matters
not which; it may well await a reader since God has waited six
thousand years for an interpreter of his works"?</p>
<p>These celebrated laws, known in astronomy as Kepler's laws, are
three in number. The first law is, that the planets describe
ellipses around the sun, which is placed in their common focus; the
second, that a line joining a planet and the sun sweeps over equal
areas in equal times; the third, that the squares of the times of
revolution of the planets about the sun are proportional to the
cubes of their mean distances from that body. The first two laws
were discovered by Kepler in the course of a laborious examination
of the theory of the planet Mars. A full account of this inquiry is
contained in his famous work, 'De Stella Martis' [Of the Planet
Mars], published in 1609. The discovery of the third law was
announced to the world in his treatise on Harmonics (1628).</p>
<p>To seek a physical cause adequate to retain the planets in their
closed orbits; to make the stability of the universe depend on
mechanical forces, and not on solid supports like the crystalline
spheres imagined by our ancestors; to extend to the heavenly bodies
in their courses the laws of earthly mechanics,--such were the
problems which remained for solution after Kepler's discoveries had
been announced. Traces of these great problems may be clearly
perceived here and there among ancient and modern writers, from
Lucretius and Plutarch down to Kepler, Bouillaud, and Borelli. It
is to Newton, however, that we must award the merit of their
solution. This great man, like several of his predecessors,
imagined the celestial bodies to have a tendency to approach each
other in virtue of some attractive force, and from the laws of
Kepler he deduced the mathematical characteristics of this force.
He extended it to all the material molecules of the solar system;
and developed his brilliant discovery in a work which, even at the
present day, is regarded as the supremest product of the human
intellect.</p>
<p>The contributions of France to these revolutions in astronomical
science consisted, in 1740, in the determination by experiment of
the spheroidal figure of the earth, and in the discovery of the
local variations of gravity upon the surface of our planet. These
were two great results; but whenever France is not first in science
she has lost her place. This rank, lost for a moment, was
brilliantly regained by the labors of four geometers. When Newton,
giving to his discoveries a generality which the laws of Kepler did
not suggest, imagined that the different planets were not only
attracted by the sun, but that they also attracted each other, he
introduced into the heavens a cause of universal perturbation.
Astronomers then saw at a glance that in no part of the universe
would the Keplerian laws suffice for the exact representation of
the phenomena of motion; that the simple regular movements with
which the imaginations of the ancients were pleased to endow the
heavenly bodies must experience numerous, considerable, perpetually
changing perturbations. To discover a few of these perturbations,
and to assign their nature and in a few rare cases their numerical
value, was the object which Newton proposed to himself in writing
his famous book, the 'Principia Mathematica Philosophi&aelig;
Naturalis' [Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy],
Notwithstanding the incomparable sagacity of its author, the
'Principia' contained merely a rough outline of planetary
perturbations, though not through any lack of ardor or
perseverance. The efforts of the great philosopher were always
superhuman, and the questions which he did not solve were simply
incapable of solution in his time.</p>
<p>Five geometers--Clairaut, Euler, D'Alembert, Lagrange, and
Laplace--shared between them the world whose existence Newton had
disclosed. They explored it in all directions, penetrated into
regions hitherto inaccessible, and pointed out phenomena hitherto
undetected. Finally--and it is this which constitutes their
imperishable glory--they brought under the domain of a single
principle, a single law, everything that seemed most occult and
mysterious in the celestial movements. Geometry had thus the
hardihood to dispose of the future, while the centuries as they
unroll scrupulously ratify the decisions of science.</p>
<p>If Newton gave a complete solution of celestial movements where
but two bodies attract each other, he did not even attempt the
infinitely more difficult problem of three. The "problem of three
bodies" (this is the name by which it has become celebrated)--the
problem of determining the movement of a body subjected to the
attractive influence of two others--was solved for the first time
by our countryman, Clairaut. Though he enumerated the various
forces which must result from the mutual action of the planets and
satellites of our system, even the great Newton did not venture to
investigate the general nature of their effects. In the midst of
the labyrinth formed by increments and diminutions of velocity,
variations in the forms of orbits, changes in distances and
inclinations, which these forces must evidently produce, the most
learned geometer would fail to discover a trustworthy guide. Forces
so numerous, so variable in direction, so different in intensity,
seemed to be incapable of maintaining a condition of equilibrium
except by a sort of miracle. Newton even suggested that the
planetary system did not contain within itself the elements of
indefinite stability. He was of opinion that a powerful hand must
intervene from time to time to repair the derangements occasioned
by the mutual action of the various bodies. Euler, better
instructed than Newton in a knowledge of these perturbations, also
refused to admit that the solar system was constituted so as to
endure forever.</p>
<p>Never did a greater philosophical question offer itself to the
inquiries of mankind. Laplace attacked it with boldness,
perseverance, and success. The profound and long-continued
researches of the illustrious geometer completely established the
perpetual variability of the planetary ellipses. He demonstrated
that the extremities of their major axes make the circuit of the
heavens; that independent of oscillation, the planes of their
orbits undergo displacements by which their intersections with the
plane of the terrestrial orbit are each year directed toward
different stars. But in the midst of this apparant chaos, there is
one element which remains constant, or is merely subject to small
and periodic changes; namely, the major axis of each orbit, and
consequently the time of revolution of each planet. This is the
element which ought to have varied most, on the principles held by
Newton and Euler. Gravitation, then, suffices to preserve the
stability of the solar system. It maintains the forms and
inclinations of the orbits in an average position, subject to
slight oscillations only; variety does not entail disorder; the
universe offers an example of harmonious relations, of a state of
perfection which Newton himself doubted.</p>
<p>This condition of harmony depends on circumstances disclosed to
Laplace by analysis; circumstances which on the surface do not seem
capable of exercising so great an influence. If instead of planets
all revolving in the same direction, in orbits but slightly
eccentric and in planes inclined at but small angles toward each
other, we should substitute different conditions, the stability of
the universe would be jeopardized, and a frightful chaos would
pretty certainly result. The discovery of the actual conditions
excluded the idea, at least so far as the solar system was
concerned, that the Newtonian attraction might be a cause of
disorder. But might not other forces, combined with the attraction
of gravitation, produce gradually increasing perturbations such as
Newton and Euler feared? Known facts seemed to justify the
apprehension. A comparison of ancient with modern observations
revealed a continual acceleration in the mean motions of the moon
and of Jupiter, and an equally striking diminution of the mean
motion of Saturn. These variations led to a very important
conclusion. In accordance with their presumed cause, to say that
the velocity of a body increased from century to century was
equivalent to asserting that the body continually approached the
centre of motion; on the other hand, when the velocity diminished,
the body must be receding from the centre. Thus, by a strange
ordering of nature, our planetary system seemed destined to lose
Saturn, its most mysterious ornament; to see the planet with its
ring and seven satellites plunge gradually into those unknown
regions where the eye armed with the most powerful telescope has
never penetrated. Jupiter, on the other hand, the planet compared
with which the earth is so insignificant, appeared to be moving in
the opposite direction, so that it would ultimately be absorbed
into the incandescent matter of the sun. Finally, it seemed that
the moon would one day precipitate itself upon the earth.</p>
<p>There was nothing doubtful or speculative in these sinister
forebodings. The precise dates of the approaching catastrophes were
alone uncertain. It was known, however, that they were very
distant. Accordingly, neither the learned dissertations of men of
science nor the animated descriptions of certain poets produced any
impression upon the public mind. The members of our scientific
societies, however, believed with regret the approaching
destruction of the planetary system. The Academy of Sciences called
the attention of geometers of all countries to these menacing
perturbations. Euler and Lagrange descended into the arena. Never
did their mathematical genius shine with a brighter lustre. Still
the question remained undecided, when from two obscure corners of
the theories of analysis, Laplace, the author of the
'M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste,' brought the laws of these great
phenomena clearly to light. The variations in velocity of Jupiter,
Saturn, and the moon, were proved to flow from evident physical
causes, and to belong in the category of ordinary periodic
perturbations depending solely on gravitation. These dreaded
variations in orbital dimensions resolved themselves into simple
oscillations included within narrow limits. In a word, by the
powerful instrumentality of mathematical analysis, the physical
universe was again established on a demonstrably firm
foundation.</p>
<p>Having demonstrated the smallness of these periodic
oscillations, Laplace next succeeded in determining the absolute
dimensions of the orbits. What is the distance of the sun from the
earth? No scientific question has occupied the attention of mankind
in a greater degree. Mathematically speaking, nothing is more
simple: it suffices, as in ordinary surveying, to draw visual lines
from the two extremities of a known base line to an inaccessible
object; the remainder of the process is an elementary calculation.
Unfortunately, in the case of the sun, the distance is very great
and the base lines which can be measured upon the earth are
comparatively very small. In such a case, the slightest errors in
the direction of visual lines exercise an enormous influence upon
the results. In the beginning of the last century, Halley had
remarked that certain interpositions of Venus between the earth and
the sun--or to use the common term, the transits of the planet
across the sun's disk--would furnish at each observing station an
indirect means of fixing the position of the visual ray much
superior in accuracy to the most perfect direct measures. Such was
the object of the many scientific expeditions undertaken in 1761
and 1769, years in which the transits of Venus occurred. A
comparison of observations made in the Southern Hemisphere with
those of Europe gave for the distance of the sun the result which
has since figured in all treatises on astronomy and navigation. No
government hesitated to furnish scientific academies with the
means, however expensive, of establishing their observers in the
most distant regions. We have already remarked that this
determination seemed imperiously to demand an extensive base, for
small bases would have been totally inadequate. Well, Laplace has
solved the problem without a base of any kind whatever; he has
deduced the distance of the sun from observations of the moon made
in one and the same place.</p>
<p>The sun is, with respect to our satellite the moon, the cause of
perturbations which evidently depend on the distance of the immense
luminous globe from the earth. Who does not see that these
perturbations must diminish if the distance increases, and increase
if the distance diminishes, so that the distance determines the
amount of the perturbations? Observation assigns the numerical
value of these perturbations; theory, on the other hand, unfolds
the general mathematical relation which connects them with the
solar distance and with other known elements. The determination of
the mean radius of the terrestrial orbit--of the distance of the
sun--then becomes one of the most simple operations of algebra.
Such is the happy combination by the aid of which Laplace has
solved the great, the celebrated problem of parallax. It is thus
that the illustrious geometer found for the mean distance of the
sun from the earth, expressed in radii of the terrestrial orbit, a
value differing but slightly from that which was the fruit of so
many troublesome and expensive voyages.</p>
<p>The movements of the moon proved a fertile mine of research to
our great geometer. His penetrating intellect discovered in them
unknown treasures. With an ability and a perseverance equally
worthy of admiration, he separated these treasures from the
coverings which had hitherto concealed them from vulgar eyes. For
example, the earth governs the movements of the moon. The earth is
flattened; in other words, its figure is spheroidal. A spheroidal
body does not attract as does a sphere. There should then exist in
the movement--I had almost said in the countenance--of the moon a
sort of impress of the spheroidal figure of the earth. Such was the
idea as it originally occurred to Laplace. By means of a minutely
careful investigation, he discovered in its motion two well-defined
perturbations, each depending on the spheroidal figure of the
earth. When these were submitted to calculation, each led to the
same value of the ellipticity. It must be recollected that the
ellipticity thus derived from the motions of the moon is not the
one corresponding to such or such a country, to the ellipticity
observed in France, in England, in Italy, in Lapland, in North
America, in India, or in the region of the Cape of Good Hope; for,
the earth's crust having undergone considerable upheavals at
different times and places, the primitive regularity of its
curvature has been sensibly disturbed thereby. The moon (and it is
this which renders the result of such inestimable value) ought to
assign, and has in reality assigned, the general ellipticity of the
earth; in other words, it has indicated a sort of average value of
the various determinations obtained at enormous expense, and with
infinite labor, as the result of long voyages undertaken by
astronomers of all the countries of Europe.</p>
<p>Certain remarks of Laplace himself bring into strong relief the
profound, the unexpected, the almost paradoxical character of the
methods I have attempted to sketch. What are the elements it has
been found necessary to confront with each other in order to arrive
at results expressed with such extreme precision? On the one hand,
mathematical formulae deduced from the principle of universal
gravitation; on the other, certain irregularities observed in the
returns of the moon to the meridian. An observing geometer, who
from his infancy had never quitted his study, and who had never
viewed the heavens except through a narrow aperture directed north
and south,--to whom nothing had ever been revealed respecting the
bodies revolving above his head, except that they attract each
other according to the Newtonian law of gravitation,--would still
perceive that his narrow abode was situated upon the surface of a
spheroidal body, whose equatorial axis was greater than its polar
by a three hundred and sixth part. In his isolated, fixed position
he could still deduce his true distance from the sun!</p>
<p>Laplace's improvement of the lunar tables not only promoted
maritime intercourse between distant countries, but preserved the
lives of mariners. Thanks to an unparalleled sagacity, to a
limitless perseverance, to an ever youthful and communicable ardor,
Laplace solved the celebrated problem of the longitude with a
precision even greater than the utmost needs of the art of
navigation demanded. The ship, the sport of the winds and tempests,
no longer fears to lose its way in the immensity of the ocean. In
every place and at every time the pilot reads in the starry heavens
his distance from the meridian of Paris. The extreme perfection of
these tables of the moon places Laplace in the ranks of the world's
benefactors.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the year 1611, Galileo supposed that he
found in the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites a simple and rigorous
solution of the famous problem of the longitude, and attempts to
introduce the new method on board the numerous vessels of Spain and
Holland at once began. They failed because the necessary
observations required powerful telescopes, which could not be
employed on a tossing ship. Even the expectations of the
serviceability of Galileo's methods for land calculations proved
premature. The movements of the satellites of Jupiter are far less
simple than the immortal Italian supposed them to be. The labors of
three more generations of astronomers and mathematicians were
needed to determine them, and the mathematical genius of Laplace
was needed to complete their labors. At the present day the
nautical ephemerides contain, several years in advance, the
indications of the times of the eclipses and reappearances of
Jupiter's satellites. Calculation is as precise as direct
observation.</p>
<p>Influenced by an exaggerated deference, modesty, timidity,
France in the eighteenth century surrendered to England the
exclusive privilege of constructing her astronomical instruments.
Thus, when Herschel was prosecuting his beautiful observations on
the other side of the Channel, we had not even the means of
verifying them. Fortunately for the scientific honor of our
country, mathematical analysis also is a powerful instrument. The
great Laplace, from the retirement of his study, foresaw, and
accurately predicted in advance, what the excellent astronomer of
Windsor would soon behold with the largest telescopes existing.
When, in 1610, Galileo directed toward Saturn a lens of very low
power which he had just constructed with his own hands, although he
perceived that the planet was not a globe, he could not ascertain
its real form. The expression "tri-corporate," by which the
illustrious Florentine designated the appearance of the planet,
even implied a totally erroneous idea of its structure. At the
present day every one knows that Saturn consists of a globe about
nine hundred times greater than the earth, and of a ring. This ring
does not touch the ball of the planet, being everywhere removed
from it to a distance of twenty thousand (English) miles.
Observation indicates the breadth of the ring to be fifty-four
thousand miles. The thickness certainly does not exceed two hundred
and fifty miles. With the exception of a black streak which divides
the ring throughout its whole contour into two parts of unequal
breadth and of different brightness, this strange colossal bridge
without foundations had never offered to the most experienced or
skillful observers either spot or protuberance adapted for deciding
whether it was immovable or endowed with a motion of rotation.
Laplace considered it to be very improbable, if the ring was
stationary, that its constituent parts should be capable of
resisting by mere cohesion the continual attraction of the planet.
A movement of rotation occurred to his mind as constituting the
principle of stability, and he deduced the necessary velocity from
this consideration. The velocity thus found was exactly equal to
that which Herschel subsequently derived from a series of extremely
delicate observations. The two parts of the ring, being at
different distances from the planet, could not fail to be given
different movements of precession by the action of the sun. Hence
it would seem that the planes of both rings ought in general to be
inclined toward each other, whereas they appear from observation
always to coincide. It was necessary then that some physical cause
capable of neutralizing the action of the sun should exist. In a
memoir published in February, 1789, Laplace found that this cause
depended on the ellipticity of Saturn produced by a rapid movement
of rotation of the planet, a movement whose discovery Herschel
announced in November of the same year.</p>
<p>If we descend from the heavens to the earth, the discoveries of
Laplace will appear not less worthy of his genius. He reduced the
phenomena of the tides, which an ancient philosopher termed in
despair "the tomb of human curiosity," to an analytical theory in
which the physical conditions of the question figure for the first
time. Consequently, to the immense advantage of coast navigation,
calculators now venture to predict in detail the time and height of
the tides several years in advance. Between the phenomena of the
ebb and flow, and the attractive forces of the sun and moon upon
the fluid sheet which covers three fourths of the globe, an
intimate and necessary connection exists; a connection from which
Laplace deduced the value of the mass of our satellite the moon.
Yet so late as the year 1631 the illustrious Galileo, as appears
from his 'Dialogues,' was so far from perceiving the mathematical
relations from which Laplace deduced results so beautiful, so
unequivocal, and so useful, that he taxed with frivolousness the
vague idea which Kepler entertained of attributing to the moon's
attraction a certain share in the production of the diurnal and
periodical movements of the waters of the ocean.</p>
<p>Laplace did not confine his genius to the extension and
improvement of the mathematical theory of the tide. He considered
the phenomenon from an entirely new point of view, and it was he
who first treated of the stability of the ocean. He has established
its equilibrium, but upon the express condition (which, however,
has been amply proved to exist) that the mean density of the fluid
mass is less than the mean density of the earth. Everything else
remaining the same, if we substituted an ocean of quicksilver for
the actual ocean, this stability would disappear. The fluid would
frequently overflow its boundaries, to ravage continents even to
the height of the snowy peaks which lose themselves in the
clouds.</p>
<p>No one was more sagacious than Laplace in discovering intimate
relations between phenomena apparently unrelated, or more skillful
in deducing important conclusions from such unexpected affinities.
For example, toward the close of his days, with the aid of certain
lunar observations, with a stroke of his pen he overthrew the
cosmogonic theories of Buffon and Bailly, which were so long in
favor. According to these theories, the earth was hastening to a
state of congelation which was close at hand. Laplace, never
contented with vague statements, sought to determine in numbers the
rate of the rapid cooling of our globe which Buffon had so
eloquently but so gratuitously announced. Nothing could be more
simple, better connected, or more conclusive than the chain of
deductions of the celebrated geometer. A body diminishes in volume
when it cools. According to the most elementary principles of
mechanics, a rotating body which contracts in dimensions must
inevitably turn upon its axis with greater and greater rapidity.
The length of the day has been determined in all ages by the time
of the earth's rotation; if the earth is cooling, the length of the
day must be continually shortening. Now, there exists a means of
ascertaining whether the length of the day has undergone any
variation; this consists in examining, for each century, the arc of
the celestial sphere described by the moon during the interval of
time which the astronomers of the existing epoch call a day; in
other words, the time required by the earth to effect a complete
rotation on its axis, the velocity of the moon being in fact
independent of the time of the earth's rotation. Let us now,
following Laplace, take from the standard tables the smallest
values, if you choose, of the expansions or contractions which
solid bodies experience from changes of temperature; let us search
the annals of Grecian, Arabian, and modern astronomy for the
purpose of finding in them the angular velocity of the moon: and
the great geometer will prove, by incontrovertible evidence founded
upon these data, that during a period of two thousand years the
mean temperature of the earth has not varied to the extent of the
hundredth part of a degree of the centigrade thermometer. Eloquence
cannot resist such a process of reasoning, or withstand the force
of such figures. Mathematics has ever been the implacable foe of
scientific romances. The constant object of Laplace was the
explanation of the great phenomena of nature according to
inflexible principles of mathematical analysis. No philosopher, no
mathematician, could have guarded himself more cautiously against a
propensity to hasty speculation. No person dreaded more the
scientific errors which cajole the imagination when it passes the
boundary of fact, calculation, and analogy.</p>
<p>Once, and once only, did Laplace launch forward, like Kepler,
like Descartes, like Leibnitz, like Buffon, into the region of
conjectures. But then his conception was nothing less than a
complete cosmogony. All the planets revolve around the sun, from
west to east, and in planes only slightly inclined to each other.
The satellites revolve around their respective primaries in the
same direction. Both planets and satellites, having a rotary
motion, turn also upon their axes from west to east. Finally, the
rotation of the sun also is directed from west to east. Here, then,
is an assemblage of forty-three movements, all operating alike. By
the calculus of probabilities, the odds are four thousand millions
to one that this coincidence in direction is not the effect of
accident.</p>
<p>It was Buffon, I think, who first attempted to explain this
singular feature of our solar system. "Wishing, in the explanation
of phenomena, to avoid recourse to causes which are not to be found
in nature," the celebrated academician sought for a physical cause
for what is common to the movements of so many bodies differing as
they do in magnitude, in form, and in their distances from the
centre of attraction. He imagined that he had discovered such a
physical cause by making this triple supposition: a comet fell
obliquely upon the sun; it pushed before it a torrent of fluid
matter; this substance, transported to a greater or less distance
from the sun according to its density, formed by condensation all
the known planets. The bold hypothesis is subject to insurmountable
difficulties. I proceed to indicate, in a few words, the cosmogonic
system which Laplace substituted for it.</p>
<p>According to Laplace, the sun was, at a remote epoch, the
central nucleus of an immense nebula, which possessed a very high
temperature, and extended far beyond the region in which Uranus now
revolves. No planet was then in existence. The solar nebula was
endowed with a general movement of rotation in the direction west
to east. As it cooled it could not fail to experience a gradual
condensation, and in consequence to rotate with greater and greater
rapidity. If the nebulous matter extended originally in the plane
of its equator, as far as the limit where the centrifugal force
exactly counterbalanced the attraction of the nucleus, the
molecules situate at this limit ought, during the process of
condensation, to separate from the rest of the atmospheric matter
and to form an equatorial zone, a ring, revolving separately and
with its primitive velocity. We may conceive that analogous
separations were effected in the remoter strata of the nebula at
different epochs and at different distances from the nucleus, and
that they gave rise to a succession of distinct rings, all lying in
nearly the same plane, and all endowed with different
velocities.</p>
<p>This being once admitted, it is easy to see that the permanent
stability of the rings would have required a regularity of
structure throughout their whole contour, which is very improbable.
Each of them, accordingly, broke in its turn into several masses,
which were obviously endowed with a movement of rotation coinciding
in direction with the common movement of revolution, and which, in
consequence of their fluidity, assumed spheroidal forms. In order,
next, that one of those spheroids may absorb all the others
belonging to the same ring, it is sufficient to suppose it to have
a mass greater than that of any other spheroid of its group.</p>
<p>Each of the planets, while in this vaporous condition to which
we have just alluded, would manifestly have a central nucleus,
gradually increasing in magnitude and mass, and an atmosphere
offering, at its successive limits, phenomena entirely similar to
those which the solar atmosphere, properly so called, had
exhibited. We are here contemplating the birth of satellites and
the birth of the ring of Saturn.</p>
<p>The Nebular Hypothesis, of which I have just given an imperfect
sketch, has for its object to show how a nebula endowed with a
general movement of rotation must eventually transform itself into
a very luminous central nucleus (a sun), and into a series of
distinct spheroidal planets, situate at considerable distances from
one another, all revolving around the central sun, in the direction
of the original movement of the nebula; how these planets ought
also to have movements of rotation in similar directions; how,
finally, the satellites, when any such are formed, must revolve
upon their axes and around their respective primaries, in the
direction of rotation of the planets and of their movement of
revolution around the sun.</p>
<p>In all that precedes, attention has been concentrated upon the
'M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste.' The 'Syst&egrave;me du Monde'
and the 'Th&eacute;orie Analytique des Probabilit&eacute;s' also
deserve description.</p>
<p>The Exposition of the System of the World is the
'M&eacute;canique C&eacute;leste' divested of that great apparatus
of analytical formulae which must be attentively perused by every
astronomer who, to use an expression of Plato, wishes to know the
numbers which govern the physical universe. It is from this work
that persons ignorant of mathematics may obtain competent knowledge
of the methods to which physical astronomy owes its astonishing
progress. Written with a noble simplicity of style, an exquisite
exactness of expression, and a scrupulous accuracy, it is
universally conceded to stand among the noblest monuments of French
literature.... The labors of all ages to persuade truth from the
heavens are there justly, clearly, and profoundly analyzed. Genius
presides as the impartial judge of genius. Throughout his work
Laplace remained at the height of his great mission. It will be
read with respect so long as the torch of science illuminates the
world.</p>
<p>The calculus of probabilities, when confined within just limits,
concerns the mathematician, the experimenter, and the statesman.
From the time when Pascal and Fermat established its first
principles, it has rendered most important daily services. This it
is which, after suggesting the best form for statistical tables of
population and mortality, teaches us to deduce from those numbers,
so often misinterpreted, the most precise and useful conclusions.
This it is which alone regulates with equity insurance premiums,
pension funds, annuities, discounts, etc. This it is that has
gradually suppressed lotteries, and other shameful snares cunningly
laid for avarice and ignorance. Laplace has treated these questions
with his accustomed superiority: the 'Analytical Theory of
Probabilities' is worthy of the author of the 'M&eacute;canique
C&eacute;leste.'</p>
<p>A philosopher whose name is associated with immortal discoveries
said to his too conservative audience, "Bear in mind, gentlemen,
that in questions of science the authority of a thousand is not
worth the humble reasoning of a single individual." Two centuries
have passed over these words of Galileo without lessening their
value or impugning their truth. For this reason, it has been
thought better rather to glance briefly at the work of Laplace than
to repeat the eulogies of his admirers.</p>

<p>rbuthnot's place in literature depends as much on his
association with the wits of his day as on his own satirical and
humorous productions. Many of these have been published in the
collections of Swift, Gay, Pope, and others, and cannot be
identified. The task of verifying them is rendered more difficult
by the fact that his son repudiated a collection claiming to be his
'Miscellaneous Works,' published in 1750.</p>
<p>John Arbuthnot was born in the manse near Arbuthnot Castle,
Kincardineshire, Scotland, April 29th, 1667. He was the son of a
Scotch Episcopal clergyman, who was soon to be dispossessed of his
parish by the Presbyterians in the Revolution of 1688. His
children, who shared his Jacobite sentiments, were forced to leave
Scotland; and John, after finishing his university course at
Aberdeen, and taking his medical degree at St. Andrews, went to
London and taught mathematics. He soon attracted attention by a
keen and satirical 'Examination of Dr. Woodward's Account of the
Deluge,' published in 1697. By a fortunate chance he was called to
attend the Prince Consort (Prince George of Denmark), and in 1705
was made Physician Extraordinary to Queen Anne. If we may believe
Swift, the agreeable Scotchman at once became her favorite
attendant. His position at court was strengthened by his
friendships with the great Tory statesmen.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-260.png" width="40%" alt=

<b>JOHN ARBUTHNOT</b></p>
<p>Arbuthnot's best remembered work is 'The History of John Bull';
not because many people read or will ever read the book itself, but
because it fixed a typical name and a typical character
ineffaceably in the popular fancy and memory. He is credited with
having been the first to use this famous sobriquet for the English
nation; he was certainly the first to make it universal, and the
first to make that burly, choleric, gross-feeding, hard-drinking,
blunt-spoken, rather stupid and decidedly gullible, but honest and
straightforward character one of the stock types of the world. The
book appeared as four separate pamphlets: the first being entitled
'Law is a Bottomless Pit, Exemplified in the Case of Lord Strutt,
John Bull, Nicholas Frog, and Lewis Baboon, Who Spent All They Had
in a Law Suit'; the second, 'John Bull in His Senses'; the third,
'John Bull Still in His Senses'; and the fourth, 'Lewis Baboon
Turned Honest, and John Bull Politician.' Published in 1712, these
were at once attributed to Swift. But Pope says, "Dr. Arbuthnot was
the sole writer of 'John Bull'"; and Swift gives us still more
conclusive evidence by writing, "I hope you read 'John Bull.' It
was a Scotch gentleman, a friend of mine, that writ it; but they
put it on to me." In his humorous preface Dr. Arbuthnot says:--</p>
<p>"When I was first called to the office of historiographer to
John Bull, he expressed himself to this purpose:--'Sir Humphrey
Polesworth, I know you are a plain dealer; it is for that reason I
have chosen you for this important trust; speak the truth, and
spare not.' That I might fulfill those, his honorable intentions, I
obtained leave to repair to and attend him in his most secret
retirements; and I put the journals of all transactions into a
strong box to be opened at a fitting occasion, after the manner of
the historiographers of some Eastern monarchs.... And now, that
posterity may not be ignorant in what age so excellent a history
was written (which would otherwise, no doubt, be the subject of its
inquiries), I think it proper to inform the learned of future times
that it was compiled when Louis XIV. was King of France, and
Philip, his grandson, of Spain; when England and Holland, in
conjunction with the Emperor and the allies, entered into a war
against these two princes, which lasted ten years, under the
management of the Duke of Marlborough, and was put to a conclusion
by the treaty of Utrecht under the ministry of the Earl of Oxford,
in the year 1713."</p>
<p>The characters disguised are: "John Bull," the English;
"Nicholas Frog," the Dutch; "Lewis Baboon," the French king; "Lord
Strutt," the late King of Spain; "Philip Baboon," the Duke of
Anjou; "Esquire South," the King of Spain; "Humphrey Hocus," the
Duke of Marlborough; and "Sir Roger Bold," the Earl of Oxford. The
lawsuit was the War of the Spanish Succession; John Bull's first
wife was the late ministry; and his second wife the Tory ministry.
To explain the allegory further, John Bull's mother was the Church
of England; his sister Peg, the Scotch nation; and her lover Jack,
Presbyterianism.</p>
<p>That so witty a work, so strong in typical freehand character
drawing of permanent validity and remembrance, should be unread and
its author forgotten except by scholars, is too curious a fact not
to have a deep cause in its own character. The cause is not hard to
find: it is one of the books which try to turn the world's current
backward, and which the world dislikes as offending its ideals of
progress. Stripped of its broad humor, its object, rubbed in with
no great delicacy of touch, was to uphold the most extreme and
reactionary Toryism of the time, and to jeer at political
liberalism from the ground up. Its theoretic loyalty is the
non-resistant Jacobitism of the Nonjurors, which it is so hard for
us now to distinguish from abject slavishness; though like the
principles of the casuists, one must not confound theory with
practice. It seems the loyalty of a mujik or a Fiji dressed in
cultivated modern clothes, not that of a conceivable cultivated
modern community as a whole; but it would be very Philistine to
pour wholesale contempt on a creed held by so many large minds and
souls. It was of course produced by the experience of what the
reverse tenets had brought on,--a long civil war, years of military
despotism, and immense social and moral disorganization. In 'John
Bull,' the fidelity of a subject to a king is made exactly
correspondent, both in theory and practice, with the fidelity of a
wife to her husband and her marriage vows; and an elaborate
parallel is worked out to show that advocating the right of
resistance to a bad king is precisely the same, on grounds of
either logic or Scripture, as advocating the right of adultery
toward a bad husband. This is not even good fooling; and, its local
use past and no longer buoyed by personal liking for the author,
the book sinks back into the limbo of partisan polemics with many
worse ones and perhaps some better ones, dragging its real
excellences down with it.</p>
<p>In 1714 the famous Scriblerus Club was organized, having for its
members Pope, Swift, Arbuthnot, Gay, Congreve, Lord Oxford, and
Bishop Atterbury. They agreed to write a series of papers
ridiculing, in the words of Pope, "all the false tastes in
learning, under the character of a man of capacity enough, but that
had dipped into every art and science, but injudiciously in each."
The chronicle of this club was found in 'The Memoirs of the
Extraordinary Life, Works, and Discoveries of Martinus Scriblerus,'
which is thought to have been written entirely by Arbuthnot, and
which describes the education of a learned pedant's son. Its humor
may be appreciated by means of the citation given below. The first
book of 'Scriblerus' appeared six years after Arbuthnot's death,
when it was included in the second volume of Alexander Pope's works
(1741). Pope said that from the 'Memoirs of Scriblerus' Swift took
his idea of 'Gulliver'; and the Dean himself writes to Arbuthnot,
July 3d, 1714:--</p>
<blockquote>"To talk of 'Martin' in any hands but Yours is a Folly.
You every day give better hints than all of us together could do in
a twelvemonth. And to say the truth, Pope, who first thought of the
Hint, has no Genius at all to it, in my mind; Gay is too young;
Parnell has some ideas of it, but is idle; I could put together,
and lard, and strike out well enough, but all that relates to the
Sciences must be from you."</blockquote>
<p>Swift's opinion that Arbuthnot "has more wit than we all have,
and his humanity is equal to his wit," seems to have been the
universal dictum; and Pope honored him by publishing a dialogue in
the 'Prologue to the Satires,' known first as 'The Epistle to Dr.
Arbuthnot,' which contains many affectionate personal allusions.
Aitken says, in his biography:--</p>
<blockquote>"Arbuthnot's attachment to Swift and Pope was of the
most intimate nature, and those who knew them best maintained that
he was their equal at least in gifts. He understood Swift's
cynicism, and their correspondence shows the unequaled sympathy
that existed between the two. Gay, Congreve, Berkeley, Parnell,
were among Arbuthnot's constant friends, and all of them were
indebted to him for kindnesses freely rendered. He was on terms of
intimacy with Bolingbroke and Oxford, Chesterfield, Peterborough,
and Pulteney; and among the ladies with whom he mixed were Lady
Mary Wortley Montagu, Lady Betty Germain, Mrs. Howard, Lady Masham,
and Mrs. Martha Blount. He was, too, the trusted friend and
physician of Queen Anne. Most of the eminent men of science of the
time, including some who were opposed to him in politics, were in
frequent intercourse with him; and it is pleasant to know that at
least one of the greatest of the wits who were most closely allied
to the Whig party--Addison--had friendly relations with
him."</blockquote>
<p>From the letters of Lord Chesterfield we learn that</p>
<blockquote>"His imagination was almost inexhaustible, and whatever
subject he treated, or was consulted upon, he immediately
overflowed with all that it could possibly produce. It was at
anybody's service, for as soon as he was exonerated he did not care
what became of it; insomuch that his sons, when young, have
frequently made kites of his scattered papers of hints, which would
have furnished good matter for folios. Not being in the least
jealous of his fame as an author, he would neither take the time
nor the trouble of separating the best from the worst; he worked
out the whole mine, which afterward, in the hands of skillful
refiners, produced a rich vein of ore. As his imagination was
always at work, he was frequently absent and inattentive in
company, which made him both say and do a thousand inoffensive
absurdities; but which, far from being provoking, as they commonly
are, supplied new matter for conversation, and occasioned wit both
in himself and others."</blockquote>
<p>Speaking to Boswell of the writers of Queen Anne's time, Dr.
Johnson said, "I think Dr. Arbuthnot the first man among them. He
was the most universal genius, being an excellent physician, a man
of deep learning, and a man of much humor." He did not, however,
think much of the 'Scriblerus' papers, and said they were forgotten
because "no man would be the wiser, better, or merrier for
remembering them"; which is hard measure for the wit and
divertingness of some of the travesties. Cowper, reviewing
Johnson's 'Lives of the Poets,' declared that "one might search
these eight volumes with a candle to find a man, and not find one,
unless perhaps Arbuthnot were he." Thackeray, too, called him "one
of the wisest, wittiest, most accomplished, gentlest of
mankind."</p>
<p>Thus fortunate in his sunny spirit, in his genius for
friendship, in his professional eminence, and in his literary
capacity, Dr. Arbuthnot saw his life flow smoothly to its close. He
died in London on February 27th, 1735, at the age of sixty eight,
still working and playing with youthful ardor, and still surrounded
with all the good things of life.</p>

<center>From 'The History of John Bull,' Part I.</center>
<br>
<p>For the better understanding the following history, the reader
ought to know that Bull, in the main, was an honest, plain-dealing
fellow, choleric, bold, and of a very unconstant temper; he dreaded
not old Lewis either at backsword, single falchion, or cudgel play;
but then he was very apt to quarrel with his best friends,
especially if they pretended to govern him. If you flattered him,
you might lead him like a child. John's temper depended very much
upon the air; his spirits rose and fell with the weather-glass.
John was quick and understood his business very well; but no man
alive was more careless in looking into his accounts, or more
cheated by partners, apprentices, and servants. This was occasioned
by his being a boon companion, loving his bottle and his diversion;
for, to say truth, no man kept a better house than John, nor spent
his money more generously. By plain and fair dealing John had
acquired some plums, and might have kept them, had it not been for
his unhappy lawsuit.</p>
<p>Nic. Frog was a cunning, sly fellow, quite the reverse of John
in many particulars; covetous, frugal, minded domestic affairs,
would pinch his belly to save his pocket, never lost a farthing by
careless servants or bad debtors. He did not care much for any sort
of diversion, except tricks of High German artists and legerdemain.
No man exceeded Nic. in these; yet it must be owned that Nic. was a
fair dealer, and in that way acquired immense riches.</p>
<p>Hocus was an old, cunning attorney; and though this was the
first considerable suit that ever he was engaged in, he showed
himself superior in address to most of his profession. He kept
always good clerks, he loved money, was smooth-tongued, gave good
words, and seldom lost his temper. He was not worse than an
infidel, for he provided plentifully for his family, but he loved
himself better than them all. The neighbors reported that he was
henpecked, which was impossible, by such a mild-spirited woman as
his wife was.</p>

<h3><a name="HOW_THE_RELATIONS_RECONCILED"></a>HOW THE RELATIONS
RECONCILED JOHN AND HIS SISTER PEG, AND WHAT RETURN PEG MADE TO
JOHN'S MESSAGE</h3>
<center>From the 'History of John Bull,' Part I.</center>
<br>
<p>John Bull, otherwise a good-natured man, was very hard-hearted
to his sister Peg, chiefly from an aversion he had conceived in his
infancy. While he flourished, kept a warm house, and drove a
plentiful trade, poor Peg was forced to go hawking and peddling
about the streets selling knives, scissors, and shoe-buckles; now
and then carried a basket of fish to the market; sewed, spun, and
knit for a livelihood till her fingers' ends were sore: and when
she could not get bread for her family, she was forced to hire them
out at journey-work to her neighbors. Yet in these, her poor
circumstances, she still preserved the air and mien of a
gentlewoman--a certain decent pride that extorted respect from the
haughtiest of her neighbors. When she came in to any full assembly,
she would not yield the <i>pas</i> to the best of them. If one
asked her, "Are you not related to John Bull?" "Yes," says she, "he
has the honor to be my brother." So Peg's affairs went till all the
relations cried out shame upon John for his barbarous usage of his
own flesh and blood; that it was an easy matter for him to put her
in a creditable way of living, not only without hurt, but with
advantage to himself, seeing she was an industrious person, and
might be serviceable to him in his way of business. "Hang her,
jade," quoth John, "I can't endure her as long as she keeps that
rascal Jack's company." They told him the way to reclaim her was to
take her into his house; that by conversation the childish humors
of their younger days might be worn out.</p>
<p>These arguments were enforced by a certain incident. It happened
that John was at that time about making his will and entailing his
estate, the very same in which Nic. Frog is named executor. Now,
his sister Peg's name being in the entail, he could not make a
thorough settlement without her consent. There was indeed a
malicious story went about, as if John's last wife had fallen in
love with Jack as he was eating custard on horseback; that she
persuaded John to take his sister into the house the better to
drive on the intrigue with Jack, concluding he would follow his
mistress Peg. All I can infer from this story is that when one has
got a bad character in the world, people will report and believe
anything of them, true or false. But to return to my story.</p>
<p>When Peg received John's message she huffed and stormed:--"My
brother John," quoth she, "is grown wondrous kind-hearted all of a
sudden, but I meikle doubt whether it be not mair for their own
conveniency than for my good; he draws up his writs and his deeds,
forsooth, and I must set my hand to them, unsight, unseen. I like
the young man he has settled upon well enough, but I think I ought
to have a valuable consideration for my consent. He wants my poor
little farm because it makes a nook in his park wall. You may e'en
tell him he has mair than he makes good use of; he gangs up and
down drinking, roaring, and quarreling, through all the country
markets, making foolish bargains in his cups, which he repents when
he is sober; like a thriftless wretch, spending the goods and gear
that his forefathers won with the sweat of their brows; light come,
light go; he cares not a farthing. But why should I stand surety
for his contracts? The little I have is free, and I can call it my
own--hame's hame, let it be never so hamely. I ken well enough, he
could never abide me, and when he has his ends he'll e'en use me as
he did before. I'm sure I shall be treated like a poor drudge--I
shall be set to tend the bairns, darn the hose, and mend the linen.
Then there's no living with that old carline, his mother; she rails
at Jack, and Jack's an honester man than any of her kin: I shall be
plagued with her spells and her Paternosters, and silly Old World
ceremonies; I mun never pare my nails on a Friday, nor begin a
journey on Childermas Day; and I mun stand becking and binging as I
gang out and into the hall. Tell him he may e'en gang his get; I'll
have nothing to do with him; I'll stay like the poor country mouse,
in my awn habitation."</p>
<p>So Peg talked; but for all that, by the interposition of good
friends, and by many a bonny thing that was sent, and many more
that were promised Peg, the matter was concluded, and Peg taken
into the house upon certain articles [the Act of Toleration is
referred to]; one of which was that she might have the freedom of
Jack's conversation, and might take him for better or for worse if
she pleased; provided always he did not come into the house at
unseasonable hours and disturb the rest of the old woman, John's
mother.</p>

<h2><a name="OF_THE_RUDIMENTS_OF_MARTIN'S_LEARNING"></a>OF THE
RUDIMENTS OF MARTIN'S LEARNING</h2>
<center>From 'Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus'</center>
<br>
<p>Mrs. Scriblerus considered it was now time to instruct him in
the fundamentals of religion, and to that end took no small pains
in teaching him his catechism. But Cornelius looked upon this as a
tedious way of instruction, and therefore employed his head to find
out more pleasing methods, the better to induce him to be fond of
learning. He would frequently carry him to the puppet-show of the
creation of the world, where the child, with exceeding delight,
gained a notion of the history of the Bible. His first rudiments in
profane history were acquired by seeing of raree-shows, where he
was brought acquainted with all the princes of Europe. In short,
the old gentleman so contrived it to make everything contribute to
the improvement of his knowledge, even to his very dress. He
invented for him a geographical suit of clothes, which might give
him some hints of that science, and likewise some knowledge of the
commerce of different nations. He had a French hat with an African
feather, Holland shirts, Flanders lace, English clothes lined with
Indian silk, his gloves were Italian, and his shoes were Spanish:
he was made to observe this, and daily catechized thereupon, which
his father was wont to call "traveling at home." He never gave him
a fig or an orange but he obliged him to give an account from what
country it came. In natural history he was much assisted by his
curiosity in sign-posts; insomuch that he hath often confessed he
owed to them the knowledge of many creatures which he never found
since in any author, such as white lions, golden dragons, etc. He
once thought the same of green men, but had since found them
mentioned by Kercherus, and verified in the history of William of
Newburg.</p>
<p>His disposition to the mathematics was discovered very early, by
his drawing parallel lines on his bread and butter, and
intersecting them at equal angles, so as to form the whole
superficies into squares. But in the midst of all these
improvements a stop was put to his learning the alphabet, nor would
he let him proceed to the letter D, till he could truly and
distinctly pronounce C in the ancient manner, at which the child
unhappily boggled for near three months. He was also obliged to
delay his learning to write, having turned away the writing-master
because he knew nothing of Fabius's waxen tables.</p>
<p>Cornelius having read and seriously weighed the methods by which
the famous Montaigne was educated, and resolving in some degree to
exceed them, resolved he should speak and learn nothing but the
learned languages, and especially the Greek; in which he constantly
eat and drank, according to Homer. But what most conduced to his
easy attainment of this language was his love of gingerbread: which
his father observing, caused to be stamped with the letters of the
Greek alphabet; and the child the very first day eat as far as
Iota. By his particular application to this language above the
rest, he attained so great a proficiency therein, that Gronovius
ingenuously confesses he durst not confer with this child in Greek
at eight years old; and at fourteen he composed a tragedy in the
same language, as the younger Pliny had done before him.</p>
<p>He learned the Oriental languages of Erpenius, who resided some
time with his father for that purpose. He had so early a relish for
the Eastern way of writing, that even at this time he composed (in
imitation of it) 'A Thousand and One Arabian Tales,' and also the
'Persian Tales,' which have been since translated into several
languages, and lately into our own with particular elegance by Mr.
Ambrose Philips. In this work of his childhood he was not a little
assisted by the historical traditions of his nurse.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_ARGONAUTIC_LEGEND"></a>THE ARGONAUTIC LEGEND</h2>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he legend of the Argonauts relates to the story of a band of
heroes who sailed from Thessaly to &AElig;a, the region of the
Sun-god on the remotest shore of the Black Sea, in quest of a
Golden Fleece. The ship Argo bore the heroes, under the command of
Jason, to whom the task had been assigned by his uncle Pelias.
Pelias was the usurper of his nephew's throne; and for Jason, on
his coming to man's estate, he devised the perilous adventure of
fetching the golden fleece of the Speaking Ram which many years
before had carried Phrixus to &AElig;a, or Colchis. Fifty of the
most distinguished Grecian heroes came to Jason's aid, while Argus,
the son of Phrixus, under the guidance of Athena, built the ship,
inserting in the prow, for prophetic advice and furtherance, a
piece of the famous talking oak of Dodona. Tiphys was the
steersman, and Orpheus joined the crew to enliven the weariness of
their sea-life with his harp.</p>
<p>The heroes came first to Lemnos, where the women had risen in
revolt and slain fathers, brothers, and husbands. Here the voyagers
lingered almost a year; but at last, having taken leave, they came
to the southern coast of Propontis, where the Doliones dwelt under
King Cyzicus. Their kind entertainment among this people was marred
by ill-fate; for having weighed anchor in the night, they were
driven back by a storm, and being mistaken for foes, were fiercely
attacked. Cyzicus himself fell by the hand of Jason. They next
touched at the country of the Bebrycians, where the hero Pollux
overcame the king in a boxing-match and bound him to a tree; and
thence to Salmydessus, to consult the soothsayer Phineus. In
gratitude for their freeing him from the Harpies, who, as often as
his table was set, descended out of the clouds upon his food and
defiled it, the prophet directed them safe to Colchis. The heroes
rowing with might, thus passed the Symplegades, two cliffs which
opened and shut with such swift violence that a bird could scarce
fly through the passage. The rocks were held apart with the help of
Athena, and from that day they became fixed and harmless. Further
on, they came in sight of Mount Caucasus, saw the eagle which
preyed on the vitals of Prometheus, and heard the sufferer's woeful
cries. So their journey was accomplished, and they arrived at
&AElig;a, and the palace of King &AElig;etes.</p>
<p>When the king heard the errand of the heroes he was moved
against them, and refused to give up the fleece except on terms
which he thought Jason durst not comply with. Two bulls, snorting
fire, with feet of brass, Jason was required to yoke, and with them
plow a field and sow the land with dragon's teeth. Here the
heavenly powers came to the hero's aid, and Hera and Athena prayed
Aphrodite to send the shaft of Cupid upon Medea, the youthful
daughter of the king. Thus it came about that Medea conceived a
great passion for the young hero, and with the magic which she knew
she made for him a salve. The salve rendered his body invulnerable.
He yoked the bulls, and ploughed the field, and sowed the dragon's
teeth. A crop of armed men sprang from the sowing, but Jason,
prepared for this marvel by Medea, threw among them a stone which
she had given him, whereupon they fell upon and slew one
another.</p>
<p>But &AElig;etes still refused to fetch the fleece, plotting
secretly to burn the Argo and kill the heroic Argonauts. Medea came
to their succor, and by her black art lulled to sleep the dragon
which guarded the fleece. They seized the pelt, boarded the Argo,
and sailed away, taking Medea with them. When her father followed
in pursuit, in the madness of her love for Jason she slew her
brother whom she had with her, and strewed the fragments of his
body upon the wave. The king stopped to recover them and give them
burial, and thus the Argonauts escaped. But the anger of the gods
at this horrible murder led the voyagers in expiation a wearisome
way homeward. For they sailed through the waters of the Adriatic,
the Nile, the circumfluous stream of the earth, passed Scylla and
Charybdis and the Island of the Sun, to Crete and &AElig;gina and
many lands, before the Argo rode once more in Thessalian
waters.</p>
<p>The legend is one of the oldest and most familiar tales of
Greece. Whether it is all poetic myth, or had a certain foundation
in fact, it is impossible now to say. The date, the geography, the
heroes, are mythical; and as in the Homeric poems, the supernatural
and seeming historical are so blended that the union is
indissoluble by any analysis yet found. The theme has touched the
imagination of poets from the time of Apollonius Rhodius, who wrote
the 'Argonautica' and went to Alexandria B.C. 194 to take care of
the great library there, to William Morris, who published his 'Life
and Death of Jason' in 1867. Mr. Morris's version of the contest of
Orpheus with the Sirens is given to illustrate the reality of the
old legends to the Greeks themselves. Jason's later life, his
putting away of Medea, his marriage with Glauce, and the revenge of
the deserted princess, furnish the story of the greatest of the
plays of Euripides.</p>

<h2><a name="LUDOVICO_ARIOSTO"></a>LUDOVICO ARIOSTO</h2>
<h3>(1474-1533)</h3>
<h3>BY L. OSCAR KUHNS</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=

<p>mong the smaller principalities of Italy during the fifteenth
and sixteenth centuries, none was more brilliant than the court of
Ferrara, and none more intimately connected with the literature of
the times. Here, on September 8th, 1474, was born Ludovico Ariosto,
the great poet of the Renaissance. Here, like Boiardo before him
and Tasso after him, he lived and wrote; and it was to the family
of Este that he dedicated that poem in which are seen, as in a
mirror, the gay life, the intellectual brilliancy, and the sensuous
love for beauty which mark the age. At seventeen he began the study
of the law, which he soon abandoned for the charms of letters. Most
of his life was passed in the service first of Cardinal d'Este, and
afterward of the Duke of Ferrara. But the courtier never overcame
the poet, who is said to have begun the famous 'Orlando Furioso' at
the age of thirty, and never to have ceased the effort to improve
it.</p>
<p>The literary activity of Ariosto showed itself in the
composition of comedies and satires, as well as in that of his
immortal epic. The comedies were written for the court theatre of
Ferrara, to which he seems to have had some such relation as that
of Goethe to the theatre at Weimar. The later comedies are much
better than the early ones, which are but little more than
translations from Plautus and Terence. In general, however, the
efforts of Ariosto in this direction are far less important than
the 'Orlando' or the 'Satires.' At the first appearance of his
plays they were enormously successful, and the poet was hailed as a
great dramatic genius. But these comedies are interesting to-day
chiefly from the fact that Ariosto was one of the very first of the
writers of modern comedy, and was the leader of that movement in
Italy and France which prepared the way for Moli&egrave;re.</p>
<p>Of more importance than the comedies, and second only in
interest to the 'Orlando' are the 'Satires' seven in number, the
first written in 1517 and the last in 1531, thus representing the
maturer life of the poet. Nearly everything we know of Ariosto's
character is taken from this source. He reveals himself in them as
a man who excites neither our highest admiration nor our contempt.
He was not born to be a statesman, nor a courtier, nor a man of
affairs; and his life as ambassador of Cardinal Ippolito, and as
captain of Garafagno, was not at all to his liking. His one longing
through all the busy years of his life was for a quiet home, where
he could live in liberty and enjoy the comforts of cultured
leisure. A love of independence was a marked trait of his
character, and it must often have galled him to play the part he
did at the court of Ferrara. As a satirist he was no Juvenal or
Persius. He was not stirred to profound indignation by the evils
about him, of which there were enough in that brilliant but corrupt
age. He discussed in easy, familiar style, the foibles of his
fellow-men, and especially the events of his own life and the
traits of his own character.</p>
<p>The same views of life, the same tolerant temper, which are seen
in the 'Satires,' form an important part of the 'Orlando Furioso,'
where they take the form of little dissertations, introduced at the
beginning of a canto, or scattered through the body of the poem.
These reflections are full of practical sense and wisdom, and
remind us of the familiar conversation with the reader which forms
so great a charm in Thackeray's novels.</p>
<p>In the Italian Renaissance there is a curious mingling of
classical and romantic influences, and the generation which gave
itself up passionately to the study of Greek and Latin still read
with delight the stories of the Paladins of Charlemagne and the
Knights of the Round Table. What Sir Thomas Malory had done in
English prose, Boiardo did in Latin poetry. When Ariosto entered
the service of Cardinal Ippolito, every one was reading the
'Orlando Innamorato,' and the young poet soon fell under the charm
of these stories; so that when the inward impulse which all great
poets feel toward the work of creation came to him, he took the
material already at hand and continued the story of 'Orlando.' With
a certain skill and inventiveness, Boiardo had mingled together the
epic cycles of Arthur and Charlemagne. He had shown the Saracen
host under King Agramante driving the army of Charlemagne before
them, until the Christians had finally been shut up within the
walls of Paris. It was at this critical moment in his poem that
Boiardo died. Ariosto took up the story where he had left it, and
carried it on until the final defeat of Agramante, and his death at
the hands of Orlando in the desert island.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illus0742.jpg" width="50%" alt=

<br>
<p>But we must not think that the 'Orlando Furioso' has one
definite plot. At first reading we are confused by the multiplicity
of incident, by the constant change of scene, and by the breaking
off of one story to make place for another. In a single canto the
scene changes from France to Africa, and by means of winged horses
tremendous distances are traveled over in a day. On closer
examination we find that this confusion is only apparent. The poet
himself is never confused, but with sure hand he manipulates the
many-colored threads which are wrought into the fabric of the poem.
The war between the Saracens and the Christians is a sort of
background or stage; a rallying point for the characters. In
reality it attracts but slightly our attention or interest. Again,
Orlando's love for Angelica, and his madness,--although the latter
gave the title to the book, and both afford some of the finest
episodes,--have no organic connection with the whole. The real
subject, if any there be, is the loves of Ruggiero and Bradamante.
These are the supposed ancestors of the house of Este, and it is
with their final union, after many vicissitudes, that the poem
ends.</p>
<p>But the real purpose of Ariosto was to amuse the reader by
countless stories of romantic adventure. It was not as a great
creative genius, as the inventor of new characters, as the earnest
and philosophical reformer, that he appears to mankind, but as the
supreme artist. Ariosto represents in its highest development that
love for form, that perfection of style, which is characteristic of
the Latin races as distinguished from the Teutonic. It is this that
makes the 'Orlando Furioso' the great epic of the Renaissance, and
that caused Galileo to bestow upon the poet the epithet
"divine."</p>
<p>For nearly thirty years Ariosto changed and polished these
lines, so that the edition of 1532 is quite different from that of
1516. The stanzas in which the poem is written are smooth and
musical, the language is so chosen as always to express the exact
shade of thought, the interest never flags. What seems the
arbitrary breaking off of a story before its close is really the
art of the poet; for he knows, were each episode to be told by
itself, we should have only a string of <i>novelle</i>, and not the
picture he desired to paint,--that of the world of chivalry, with
its knights-errant in search of adventures, its damsels in
distress, its beautiful gardens and lordly palaces, its hermits and
magicians, its hippogriffs and dragons, and all the paraphernalia
of magic art.</p>
<p>Ariosto's treatment of chivalry is peculiar to himself. Spenser
in the sixteenth century, and Lord Tennyson in our own day,
pictured its virtues and noble aspirations. In his immortal 'Don
Quixote,' Cervantes held its extravagances up to ridicule. In
Ariosto's day no one believed any longer in the heroes or the
ideals of chivalry, nor did the poet himself; hence there is an air
of unreality about the poem. The figures that pass before us,
although they have certain characteristics of their own, are not
real beings, but those that dwell in a land of fancy. As the poet
tells these stories of a bygone age, a smile of irony plays upon
his face; he cannot take them seriously; and while he never goes so
far as to turn into ridicule the ideals of chivalry, yet, in such
episodes as the prodigious exploits of Rodomonte within the walls
of Paris, and the voyage of Astolfo to the moon, he does approach
dangerously near to the burlesque.</p>
<p>We are not inspired by large and noble thoughts in reading the
'Orlando Furioso.' We are not deeply stirred by pity or terror. No
lofty principles are inculcated. Even the pathetic scenes, such as
the death of Zerbino and Isabella, stir no real emotion in us, but
we experience a sense of the artistic effect of a poetic death.</p>
<p>It is not often, in these days of the making of many books of
which there is no end, that one has time to read a poem which is
longer than the 'Iliad' and the 'Odyssey' together. But there is a
compelling charm about the 'Orlando,' and he who sits down to read
it with serious purpose will soon find himself under the spell of
an attraction which comes from unflagging interest and from
perfection of style and construction. No translation can convey an
adequate sense of this beauty of color and form; but the versions
of William Stewart Rose, here cited, suggest the energy, invention,
and intensity of the epic.</p>
<p>In 1532 Ariosto published his final edition of the poem, now
enlarged to forty-six cantos, and retouched from beginning to end.
He died not long afterward, in 1533, and was buried in the church
of San Benedetto, where a magnificent monument marks his
resting-place.</p>

<h2><a name="ARISTOPHANES"></a>ARISTOPHANES</h2>
<h3>(B.C. 448-380?)</h3>
<h3>BY PAUL SHOREY</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he birth-year of Aristophanes is placed about 448 B.C., on the
ground that he is said to have been almost a boy when his first
comedy was presented in 427. His last play, the 'Plutus,' was
produced in 388, and there is no evidence that he long survived
this date. Little is known of his life beyond the allusions, in the
Parabases of the 'Acharnians,' 'Knights,' and 'Wasps,' to his
prosecution by Cleon, to his own or his father's estate at Aegina,
and to his premature baldness. He left three sons who also wrote
comedies.</p>
<p>Aristophanes is the sole extant representative of the so-called
Old Comedy of Athens; a form of dramatic art which developed
obscurely under the shadow of Attic Tragedy in the first half of
the fifth century B.C., out of the rustic revelry of the Phallic
procession and Comus song of Dionysus, perhaps with some outside
suggestions from the Megarian farce and its Sicilian offshoot, the
mythological court comedy of Epicharmus. The chief note of this
older comedy for the ancient critics was its unbridled license of
direct personal satire and invective. Eupolis, Cratinus, and
Aristophanes, says Horace, assailed with the utmost freedom any one
who deserved to be branded with infamy. This old political Comedy
was succeeded in the calmer times that followed the Peloponnesian
War by the so-called Middle Comedy (390-320) of Alexis, Antiphanes,
Strattis, and some minor men; which insensibly passed into the New
Comedy (320-250) of Menander and Philemon, known to us in the
reproductions of Terence. And this new comedy, which portrayed
types of private life instead of satirizing noted persons by name,
and which, as Aristotle says, produced laughter by innuendo rather
than by scurrility, was preferred to the "terrible graces" of her
elder sister by the gentle and refined Plutarch, or the critic who
has usurped his name in the 'Comparison of Aristophanes and
Menander.' The old Attic Comedy has been variously compared to
Charivari, Punch, the comic opera of Offenbach, and a Parisian
'revue de fin d'ann&eacute;e.' There is no good modern analogue. It
is not our comedy of manners, plot, and situation; nor yet is it
mere buffoonery. It is a peculiar mixture of broad political,
social, and literary satire, and polemical discussion of large
ideas, with the burlesque and licentious extravagances that were
deemed the most acceptable service at the festival of the
laughter-loving, tongue-loosening god of the vine.</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-300.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>ARISTOPHANES</b></p>
<p>The typical plan of an Aristophanic comedy is very simple. The
protagonist undertakes in all apparent seriousness to give a local
habitation and a body to some ingenious fancy, airy speculation, or
bold metaphor: as for example, the procuring of a private peace for
a citizen who is weary of the privations of war; or the
establishment of a city in Cloud-Cuckoo-Land where the birds shall
regulate things better than the featherless biped, man; or the
restoration of the eyesight of the proverbially blind god of
Wealth. The attention of the audience is at once enlisted for the
semblance of a plot by which the scheme is put into execution. The
design once effected, the remainder of the play is given over to a
series of loosely connected scenes, ascending to a climax of
absurdity, in which the consequences of the original happy thought
are followed out with a Swiftian verisimilitude of piquant detail
and a Rabelaisian license of uproarious mirth. It rests with the
audience to take the whole as pure extravaganza, or as a
<i>reductio ad absurdum</i> or playful defense of the conception
underlying the original idea. In the intervals between the scenes,
the chorus sing rollicking topical songs or bits of exquisite
lyric, or in the name of the poet directly exhort and admonish the
audience in the so-called Parabasis.</p>
<p>Of Aristophanes's first two plays, the 'Banqueters of Hercules'
(427), and the 'Babylonians' (426), only fragments remain. The
impolitic representation in the latter of the Athenian allies as
branded Babylonian slaves was the ground of Cleon's attack in the
courts upon Aristophanes, or Callistratus in whose name the play
was produced.</p>
<p>The extant plays are the following:--</p>
<p>'The Acharnians,' B.C. 425, shortly after the Athenian defeat at
Delium. The worthy countryman, Dic&aelig;opolis, weary of being
cooped up within the Long Walls, and disgusted with the shameless
jobbery of the politicians, sends to Sparta for samples of peace
(the Greek word means also libations) of different vintages. The
Thirty Years' brand smells of nectar and ambrosia. He accepts it,
concludes a private treaty for himself and friends, and proceeds to
celebrate the rural Dionysia with wife and child, soothing, by an
eloquent plea pronounced in tattered tragic vestments borrowed from
Euripides, the anger of the chorus of choleric Acharnian charcoal
burners, exasperated at the repeated devastation of their deme by
the Spartans. He then opens a market, to which a jolly Boeotian
brings the long-lost, thrice-desired Copaic eel; while a starveling
Megarian, to the huge delight of the Athenian groundlings, sells
his little daughters, disguised as pigs, for a peck of salt.
Finally Dic&aelig;opolis goes forth to a wedding banquet, from
which he returns very mellow in the company of two flute girls;
while Lamachus, the head of the war party, issues forth to do
battle with the Boeotians in the snow, and comes back with a bloody
coxcomb. This play was successfully given in Greek by the students
of the University of Pennsylvania in the spring of 1886, and
interestingly discussed in the Nation of May 6th by Professor
Gildersleeve.</p>
<p>'The Knights,' B.C. 424: named from the chorus of young Athenian
cavaliers who abet the sausage-seller, Agoracritus, egged on by the
discontented family servants (the generals), Nicias and
Demosthenes, to outbid with shameless flattery the rascally
Paphlagonian steward, Cleon, and supplant him in the favor of their
testy bean-fed old master, Demos (or People). At the close, Demos
recovers his wits and his youth, and is revealed sitting enthroned
in his glory in the good old Marathonian Athens of the Violet
Crown. The prolongation of the billingsgate in the contest between
Cleon and the sausage-seller grows wearisome to modern taste; but
the portrait of the Demagogue is for all time.</p>
<p>'The Clouds,' B.C. 423: an attack on Socrates, unfairly taken as
an embodiment of the deleterious and unsettling "new learning,"
both in the form of Sophistical rhetoric and "meteorological"
speculation. Worthy Strepsiades, eager to find a new way to pay the
debts in which the extravagance of his horse-racing son
Pheidippides has involved him, seeks to enter the youth as a
student in the Thinking-shop or Reflectory of Socrates, that he may
learn to make the worse appear the better reason, and so baffle his
creditors before a jury. The young man, after much demur and the
ludicrous failure of his father, who at first matriculates in his
stead, consents. He listens to the pleas of the just and unjust
argument in behalf of the old and new education, and becomes
himself such a proficient that he demonstrates, in flawless
reasoning, that Euripides is a better poet than Aeschylus, and that
a boy is justified in beating his father for affirming the
contrary. Strepsiades thereupon, cured of his folly, undertakes a
subtle investigation into the timbers of the roof of the
Reflectory, with a view to smoking out the corrupters of youth.
Many of the songs sung by or to the clouds, the patron deities of
Socrates's misty lore, are extremely beautiful. Socrates is made to
allude to these attacks of comedy by Plato in the 'Apology,' and,
on his last day in prison, in the 'Ph&aelig;do.' In the 'Symposium'
or 'Banquet' of Plato, Aristophanes bursts in upon a company of
friends with whom Socrates is feasting, and drinks with them till
morning; while Socrates forces him and the tragic poet Agathon,
both of them very sleepy, to admit that the true dramatic artist
will excel in both tragedy and comedy.</p>
<p>'The Wasps,' B.C. 422: a <i>jeu d'esprit</i> turning on the
Athenian passion for litigation. Young Bdelucleon (hate-Cleon) can
keep his old father Philocleon (love-Cleon) out of the courts only
by instituting a private court in his own house. The first culprit,
the house-dog, is tried for stealing a Sicilian cheese, and
acquitted by Philocleon's mistaking the urn of acquittal for that
of condemnation. The old man is inconsolable at the first escape of
a victim from his clutches; but finally, renouncing his folly,
takes lessons from his exquisite of a son in the manners and
deportment of a fine gentleman. He then attends a dinner party,
where he betters his instructions with comic exaggeration and
returns home in high feather, singing tipsy catches and assaulting
the watch on his way. The chorus of Wasps, the visible embodiment
of a metaphor found also in Plato's 'Republic,' symbolizes the
sting used by the Athenian jurymen to make the rich disgorge a
portion of their gathered honey. The 'Plaideurs' of Racine is an
imitation of this play; and the <i>motif</i> of the committal of
the dog is borrowed by Ben Jonson in the 'Staple of News.'</p>
<p>'The Peace,' B.C. 421: in support of the Peace of Nicias,
ratified soon afterward (Grote's 'History of Greece,' Vol. vi.,
page 492). Tryg&aelig;us, an honest vine-dresser yearning for his
farm, in parody of the Bellerophon of Euripides, ascends to heaven
on a dung-beetle. He there hauls Peace from the bottom of the well
into which she had been cast by Ares, and brings her home in
triumph to Greece, when she inaugurates a reign of plenty and
uproarious jollity, and celebrates the nuptials of Tryg&aelig;us
and her handmaid Opora (Harvest-home).</p>
<p>'The Birds,' B.C. 414. Peisthet&aelig;rus (Plausible) and
Euelpides (Hopeful), whose names and deeds are perhaps a satire on
the unbounded ambition that brought ruin on Athens at Syracuse,
journey to Birdland and persuade King Hoopoe to induce the birds to
build Nephelococcygia or Cloud-Cuckoo-Burgh in the air between the
gods and men, starve out the gods with a "Melian famine," and rule
the world themselves. The gods, their supplies of incense cut off,
are forced to treat, and Peisthet&aelig;rus receives in marriage
Basileia (Sovereignty), the daughter of Zeus. The <i>mise en
sc&egrave;ne</i>, with the gorgeous plumage of the bird-chorus,
must have been very impressive, and many of the choric songs are
exceedingly beautiful. There is an interesting account by Professor
Jebb in the Fortnightly Review (Vol. xli.) of a performance of 'The
Birds' at Cambridge in 1884.</p>
<p>Two plays, B.C. 411: (1) at the Len&aelig;a, 'The Lysistrata,'
in which the women of Athens and Sparta by a secession from bed and
board compel their husbands to end the war; (2) The
'Thesmophoriazus&aelig;' or Women's Festival of Demeter, a
licentious but irresistibly funny assault upon Euripides. The
tragedian, learning that the women in council assembled are
debating on the punishment due to his misogyny, implores the
effeminate poet Agathon to intercede for him. That failing, he
dispatches his kinsman Mnesilochus, disguised with singed beard and
woman's robes, a sight to shake the midriff of despair with
laughter, to plead his cause. The advocate's excess of zeal betrays
him; he is arrested: and the remainder of the play is occupied by
the ludicrous devices, borrowed or parodied from well-known
Euripidean tragedies, by which the poet endeavors to rescue his
intercessor.</p>
<p>'The Frogs,' B.C. 405, in the brief respite of hope between the
victory of Arginus&aelig; and the final overthrow of Athens at
&AElig;gospotami. Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides are dead. The
minor bards are a puny folk, and Dionysus is resolved to descend to
Hades in quest of a truly creative poet, one capable of a figure
like "my star god's glow-worm," or "His honor rooted in dishonor
stood." After many surprising adventures by the way, and in the
outer precincts of the underworld, accompanied by his Sancho Panza,
Xanthias, he arrives at the court of Pluto just in time to be
chosen arbitrator of the great contest between Aeschylus and
Euripides for the tragic throne in Hades. The comparisons and
parodies of the styles of Aeschylus and Euripides that follow,
constitute, in spite of their comic exaggeration, one of the most
entertaining and discriminating chapters of literary criticism
extant, and give us an exalted idea of the intelligence of the
audience that appreciated them. Dionysus decides for
&AElig;schylus, and leads him back in triumph to the upper
world.</p>
<p>The 'Ecclesiazus&aelig;' or 'Ladies in Parliament,' B.C. 393:
apparently a satire on the communistic theories which must have
been current in the discussions of the schools before they found
definite expression in Plato's 'Republic.' The ladies of Athens
rise betimes, purloin their husbands' hats and canes, pack the
Assembly, and pass a measure to intrust the reins of government to
women. An extravagant and licentious communism is the result.</p>
<p>The 'Plutus,' B.C. 388: a second and much altered edition of a
play represented for the first time in 408. With the
'Ecclesiazus&aelig;' it marks the transition to the Middle Comedy,
there being no parabasis, and little of the exuberant <i>verve</i>
of the older pieces. The blind god of Wealth recovers his eyesight
by sleeping in the temple of &AElig;sculapius, and proceeds to
distribute the gifts of fortune more equitably.</p>
<p>The assignment of the dates and restoration of the plots of the
thirty-two lost plays, of which a few not very interesting
fragments remain, belong to the domain of conjectural
erudition.</p>
<p>Aristophanes has been regarded by some critics as a grave moral
censor, veiling his high purpose behind the grinning mask of
comedy; by others as a buffoon of genius, whose only object was to
raise a laugh. Both sides of the question are ingeniously and
copiously argued in Browning's 'Aristophanes' Apology'; and there
is a judicious summing up of the case of Aristophanes <i>vs</i>.
Euripides in Professor Jebb's lectures on Greek poetry. The soberer
view seems to be that while predominantly a comic artist, obeying
the instincts of his genius, he did frequently make his comedy the
vehicle of an earnest conservative polemic against the new spirit
of the age in Literature, Philosophy, and Politics. He pursued
Euripides with relentless ridicule because his dramatic motives
lent themselves to parody, and his lines were on the lips of every
theatre-goer; but also because he believed that Euripides had
spoiled the old, stately, heroic art of Aeschylus and Sophocles by
incongruous infusions of realism and sentimentalism, and had
debased the "large utterance of the early gods" by an unhallowed
mixture of colloquialism, dialectic, and chicane.</p>
<p>Aristophanes travestied the teachings of Socrates because his
ungainly figure, and the oddity (<i>atopia</i>) attributed to him
even by Plato, made him an excellent butt; yet also because he felt
strongly that it was better for the young Athenian to spend his
days in the Pal&aelig;stra, or "where the elm-tree whispers to the
plane," than in filing a contentious tongue on barren logomachies.
That Socrates in fact discussed only ethical problems, and
disclaimed all sympathy with speculations about things above our
heads, made no difference: he was the best human embodiment of a
hateful educational error. And similarly the assault upon Cleon,
the "pun-pelleting of demagogues from Pnux," was partly due to the
young aristocrat's instinctive aversion to the coarse popular
leader, and to the broad mark which the latter presented to the
shafts of satire, but equally, perhaps, to a genuine patriotic
revolt at the degradation of Athenian politics in the hands of the
successors of Pericles.</p>
<p>But Aristophanes's ideas interest us less than his art and
humor. We have seen the nature of his plots. In such a topsy-turvy
world there is little opportunity for nice delineation of
character. His personages are mainly symbols or caricatures. Yet
they are vividly if broadly sketched, and genuine touches of human
nature lend verisimilitude to their most improbable actions. One or
two traditional comic types appear for the first time, apparently,
on his stage: the alternately cringing and familiar slave or valet
of comedy, in his Xanthias and Karion; and in Dic&aelig;opolis,
Strepsiades, Demos, Tryg&aelig;us, and Dionysus, the sensual,
jovial, shrewd, yet na&iuml;ve and credulous middle-aged
<i>bourgeois gentilhomme</i> or 'Sganarelle,' who is not ashamed to
avow his poltroonery, and yet can, on occasion, maintain his rights
with sturdy independence.</p>
<p>But the chief attraction of Aristophanes is the abounding comic
force and <i>verve</i> of his style. It resembles an impetuous
torrent, whose swift rush purifies in its flow the grossness and
obscenity inseparable from the origin of comedy, and buoys up and
sweeps along on the current of fancy and improvisation the chaff
and dross of vulgar jests, puns, scurrilous personalities, and
cheap "gags," allowing no time for chilling reflections or
criticism. Jests which are singly feeble combine to induce a mood
of extravagant hilarity when huddled upon us with such "impossible
conveyance." This <i>vivida vis animi</i> can hardly be reproduced
in a translation, and disappears altogether in an attempt at an
abstract enumeration of the poet's inexhaustible devices for comic
effect. He himself repeatedly boasts of the fertility of his
invention, and claims to have discarded the coarse farce of his
predecessors for something more worthy of the refined intelligence
of his clever audience. Yet it must be acknowledged that much even
of his wit is the mere filth-throwing of a naughty boy; or at best
the underbred jocularity of the "funny column," the topical song,
or the minstrel show. There are puns on the names of notable
personages; a grotesque, fantastic, punning fauna, flora, and
geography of Greece; a constant succession of surprises effected by
the sudden substitution of low or incongruous terms in proverbs,
quotations, and legal or religious formulas; scenes in dialect,
scenes of excellent fooling in the vein of Uncle Toby and the
Clown, girds at the audience, personalities that for us have lost
their point,--about Cleonymus the caster-away of shields, or
Euripides's herb-selling mother,--and everywhere unstinted service
to the great gods Priapus and Cloacina.</p>
<p>A finer instrument of comic effect is the parody. The countless
parodies of the lyric and dramatic literature of Greece are perhaps
the most remarkable testimony extant to the intelligence of an
Athenian audience. Did they infallibly catch the allusion when
Dic&aelig;opolis welcomed back to the Athenian fish-market the
long-lost Copaic eel in high &AElig;schylean strain,--</p>
<blockquote>"Of fifty nymphs Copaic alderliefest
queen,"</blockquote>
<p>and then, his voice breaking with the intolerable pathos of
Admetus's farewell to the dying Alcestis, added,</p>
<p class="heading">"Yea, even in death</p>
<blockquote>Thou'lt bide with me, embalmed and
beet-bestewed"?</blockquote>
<p>Did they recognize the blasphemous Pindaric pun in "Helle's holy
straits," for a tight place, and appreciate all the niceties of
diction, metre, and dramatic art discriminated in the comparison
between Aeschylus and Euripides in the 'Frogs'? At any rate, no
Athenian could miss the fun of Dic&aelig;opolis (like Hector's
baby) "scared at the dazzling plume and nodding crest" of the
swashbuckler Lamachus, of Philocleon, clinging to his ass's belly
like Odysseus escaping under the ram from the Cyclops's cave; of
the baby in the Thesmophoriazus&aelig; seized as a Euripidean
hostage, and turning out a wine bottle in swaddling-clothes; of
light-foot Iris in the r&ocirc;le of a saucy, frightened soubrette;
of the heaven-defying &AElig;schylean Prometheus hiding under an
umbrella from the thunderbolts of Zeus. And they must have felt
instinctively what only a laborious erudition reveals to us, the
sudden subtle modulations of the colloquial comic verse into
mock-heroic travesty of high tragedy or lyric.</p>
<p>Euripides, the chief victim of Aristophanes's genius for parody,
was so burlesqued that his best known lines became by-words, and
his most ardent admirers, the very Balaustions and Euthukleses,
must have grinned when they heard them, like a pair of augurs. If
we conceive five or six Shakespearean comedies filled from end to
end with ancient Pistols hallooing to "pampered jades of Asia," and
Dr. Caiuses chanting of "a thousand vagrom posies," we may form
some idea of Aristophanes's handling of the notorious lines--</p>
<blockquote>"The tongue has sworn, the mind remains unsworn."<br>
"Thou lovest life, thy sire loves it too."<br>
"Who knows if life and death be truly one?"</blockquote>
<p>But the charm of Aristophanes does not lie in any of these
things singly, but in the combination of ingenious and paradoxical
fancy with an inexhaustible flow of apt language by which they are
held up and borne out. His personages are ready to make believe
anything. Nothing surprises them long. They enter into the spirit
of each new conceit, and can always discover fresh analogies to
bear it out. The very plots of his plays are realized metaphors or
embodied conceits. And the same concrete vividness of imagination
is displayed in single scenes and episodes. The Better and the
Worse Reason plead the causes of the old and new education in
person. Cleon and Brasidas are the pestles with which War proposes
to bray Greece in a mortar; the triremes of Athens in council
assembled declare that they will rot in the docks sooner than yield
their virginity to musty, fusty Hyperbolus. The fair cities of
Greece stand about waiting for the recovery of Peace from her Well,
with dreadful black eyes, poor things; Armisticia and Harvest-Home
tread the stage in the flesh, and Nincompoop and Defraudation are
among the gods.</p>
<p>The special metaphor or conceit of each play attracts
appropriate words and images, and creates a distinct atmosphere of
its own. In the 'Knights' the air fairly reeks with the smell of
leather and the tanyard. The 'Birds' transport us to a world of
trillings and pipings, and beaks and feathers. There is a buzzing
and a humming and a stinging throughout the 'Wasps.' The 'Clouds'
drip with mist, and are dim with a&euml;rial vaporous effects.</p>
<p>Aristophanes was the original inventor of Bob Acres's style of
oath--the so-called referential or sentimental swearing.
Dic&aelig;opolis invokes Ecbatana when Shamartabas struts upon the
stage. Socrates in the 'Clouds' swears by the everlasting vapors.
King Hoopoe's favorite oath is "Odds nets and birdlime." And the
vein of humor that lies in over-ingenious, elaborate, and sustained
metaphor was first worked in these comedies. All these excellences
are summed up in the incomparable wealth and flexibility of his
vocabulary. He has a Shakespearean mastery of the technicalities of
every art and mystery, an appalling command of billingsgate and of
the language of the cuisine, and would tire Falstaff and Prince Hal
with base comparisons. And not content with the existing resources
of the Greek vocabulary, he coins grotesque or beautiful
compounds,--exquisite epithets like "Botruod&ouml;r&eacute;"
(bestower of the vine), "heliomanes" (drunk-with-sunlight),
"myriad-flagoned phrases," untranslatable "port-manteaus" like
"plouthugieia" (health-and-wealthfulness), and Gargantuan
agglomerations of syllables like the portentous <i>olla podrida</i>
at the end of the 'Ecclesiazus&aelig;.'</p>
<p>The great comic writer, as the example of Moli&egrave;re proves,
need not be a poet. But the mere overflow of careless poetic power
which is manifested by Aristophanes would have sufficed to set up
any ordinary tragedian or lyrist. In plastic mastery of language
only two Greek writers can vie with him, Plato and Homer. In the
easy grace and native harmony of his verse he outsings all the
tragedians, even that Aeschylus whom he praised as the man who had
written the most exquisite songs of any poet of the time. In his
blank verse he easily strikes every note, from that of the urbane,
unaffected, colloquial Attic, to parody of high or subtle tragic
diction hardly distinguishable from its model. He can adapt his
metres to the expression of every shade of feeling. He has short,
snapping, fiery trochees, like sparks from their own holm oak, to
represent the choler of the Acharnians; eager, joyous glyconics to
bundle up a sycophant and hustle him off the stage, or for the
young knights of Athens celebrating Phormio's sea fights, and
chanting, horse-taming Poseidon, Pallas, guardian of the State, and
Victory, companion of the dance; the quickstep march of the
trochaic tetrameter to tell how the Attic wasps, true children of
the soil, charged the Persians at Marathon; and above all--the
chosen vehicle of his wildest conceits, his most audacious fancies,
and his strongest appeals to the better judgment of the
citizens--the anap&aelig;stic tetrameter, that "resonant and
triumphant" metre of which even Mr. Swinburne's anap&aelig;sts can
reproduce only a faint and far-off echo.</p>
<p>But he has more than the opulent diction and the singing voice
of the poet. He has the key to fairy-land, a feeling for nature
which we thought romantic and modern, and in his lyrics the native
wood-notes wild of his own 'Mousa lochmaia' (the muse of the
coppice). The chorus of the Myst&aelig; in the 'Frogs,' the rustic
idyl of the 'Peace,' the songs of the girls in the 'Lysistrata,'
the call of the nightingale, the hymns of the 'Clouds,' the speech
of the "Just Reason," and the grand chorus of birds, reveal
Aristophanes as not only the first comic writer of Greece, but as
one of the very greatest of her poets.</p>
<p>Among the many editions of Aristophanes, those most useful to
the student and the general reader are doubtless the text edited by
Bergk (2 vols., 1867), and the translations of the five most famous
plays by John Hookham Frere, to be found in his complete works.</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Be not surprised, most excellent spectators,</p>
<p class="i6">If I that am a beggar have presumed</p>
<p class="i6">To claim an audience upon public matters,</p>
<p class="i6">Even in a comedy; for comedy</p>
<p class="i6">Is conversant in all the rules of justice,</p>
<p class="i6">And can distinguish betwixt right and wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">The words I speak are bold, but just and true.</p>
<p class="i6">Cleon at least cannot accuse me now,</p>
<p class="i6">That I defame the city before strangers,</p>
<p class="i6">For this is the Len&aelig;an festival,</p>
<p class="i6">And here we meet, all by ourselves alone;</p>
<p class="i6">No deputies are arrived as yet with tribute,</p>
<p class="i6">No strangers or allies: but here we sit</p>
<p class="i6">A chosen sample, clean as sifted corn,</p>
<p class="i6">With our own denizens as a kind of chaff.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">First, I detest the Spartans most extremely;</p>
<p class="i6">And wish that Neptune, the T&aelig;narian deity,</p>
<p class="i6">Would bury them in their houses with his
earthquakes.</p>
<p class="i6">For I've had losses--losses, let me tell ye,</p>
<p class="i6">Like other people; vines cut down and injured.</p>
<p class="i6">But among friends (for only friends are here),</p>
<p class="i6">Why should we blame the Spartans for all this?</p>
<p class="i6">For people of ours, some people of our own,--</p>
<p class="i6">Some people from among us here, I mean:</p>
<p class="i6">But not the People (pray, remember that);</p>
<p class="i6">I never said the People, but a pack</p>
<p class="i6">Of paltry people, mere pretended citizens,</p>
<p class="i6">Base counterfeits,--went laying informations,</p>
<p class="i6">And making a confiscation of the jerkins</p>
<p class="i6">Imported here from Megara; pigs, moreover,</p>
<p class="i6">Pumpkins, and pecks of salt, and ropes of onions,</p>
<p class="i6">Were voted to be merchandise from Megara,</p>
<p class="i6">Denounced, and seized, and sold upon the spot.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Well, these might pass, as petty local matters.</p>
<p class="i6">But now, behold, some doughty drunken youths</p>
<p class="i6">Kidnap, and carry away from Megara,</p>
<p class="i6">The courtesan, Sim&aelig;tha. Those of Megara,</p>
<p class="i6">In hot retaliation, seize a brace</p>
<p class="i6">Of equal strumpets, hurried forth perforce</p>
<p class="i6">From Dame Aspasia's house of recreation.</p>
<p class="i6">So this was the beginning of the war,</p>
<p class="i6">All over Greece, owing to these three strumpets.</p>
<p class="i6">For Pericles, like an Olympian Jove,</p>
<p class="i6">With all his thunder and his thunderbolts,</p>
<p class="i6">Began to storm and lighten dreadfully,</p>
<p class="i6">Alarming all the neighborhood of Greece;</p>
<p class="i6">And made decrees, drawn up like drinking songs,</p>
<p class="i6">In which it was enacted and concluded</p>
<p class="i6">That the Megarians should remain excluded</p>
<p class="i6">From every place where commerce was transacted,</p>
<p class="i6">With all their ware--like "old Care" in the
ballad:</p>
<p class="i6">And this decree, by land and sea, was valid.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i6">Then the Megarians, being all half starved,</p>
<p class="i6">Desired the Spartans to desire of us</p>
<p class="i6">Just to repeal those laws: the laws I mentioned,</p>
<p class="i6">Occasioned by the stealing of those strumpets.</p>
<p class="i6">And so they begged and prayed us several times;</p>
<p class="i6">And we refused: and so they went to war.</p>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p class="i8">Our poet has never as yet</p>
<p class="i8">Esteemed it proper or fit</p>
<p class="i8">To detain you with a long</p>
<p class="i8">Encomiastic song</p>
<p class="i8">On his own superior wit;</p>
<p class="i8">But being abused and accused,</p>
<p class="i8">And attacked of late</p>
<p class="i8">As a foe of the State,</p>
<p class="i5">He makes an appeal in his proper defense,</p>
<p class="i5">To your voluble humor and temper and sense,</p>
<p class="i8">With the following plea:</p>
<p class="i8">Namely, that he</p>
<p class="i7">Never attempted or ever meant</p>
<p class="i9">To scandalize</p>
<p class="i9">In any wise</p>
<p class="i7">Your mighty imperial government.</p>
<p class="i8">Moreover he says,</p>
<p class="i8">That in various ways</p>
<p class="i5">He presumes to have merited honor and praise;</p>
<p class="i5">Exhorting you still to stick to your rights,</p>
<p class="i5">And no more to be fooled with rhetorical flights;</p>
<p class="i7">Such as of late each envoy tries</p>
<p class="i7">On the behalf of your allies,</p>
<p class="i6">That come to plead their cause before ye,</p>
<p class="i6">With fulsome phrase, and a foolish story</p>
<p class="i6">Of "violet crowns" and "Athenian glory,"</p>
<p class="i6">With "sumptuous Athens" at every word:</p>
<p class="i6">"Sumptuous Athens" is always heard;</p>
<p class="i6">"Sumptuous" ever, a suitable phrase</p>
<p class="i6">For a dish of meat or a beast at graze.</p>
<p class="i9">He therefore affirms</p>
<p class="i9">In confident terms,</p>
<p class="i6">That his active courage and earnest zeal</p>
<p class="i6">Have usefully served your common weal:</p>
<p class="i9">He has openly shown</p>
<p class="i9">The style and tone</p>
<p class="i6">Of your democracy ruling abroad,</p>
<p class="i6">He has placed its practices on record;</p>
<p class="i6">The tyrannical arts, the knavish tricks,</p>
<p class="i6">That poison all your politics.</p>
<p class="i6">Therefore shall we see, this year,</p>
<p class="i6">The allies with tribute arriving here,</p>
<p class="i6">Eager and anxious all to behold</p>
<p class="i6">Their steady protector, the bard so bold;</p>
<p class="i6">The bard, they say, that has dared to speak,</p>
<p class="i6">To attack the strong, to defend the weak.</p>
<p class="i6">His fame in foreign climes is heard,</p>
<p class="i6">And a singular instance lately occurred.</p>
<p class="i6">It occurred in the case of the Persian king,</p>
<p class="i6">Sifting and cross-examining</p>
<p class="i6">The Spartan envoys. He demanded</p>
<p class="i6">Which of the rival States commanded</p>
<p class="i6">The Grecian seas? He asked them next</p>
<p class="i6">(Wishing to see them more perplexed)</p>
<p class="i6">Which of the two contending powers</p>
<p class="i6">Was chiefly abused by this bard of ours?</p>
<p class="i6">For he said, "Such a bold, so profound an adviser</p>
<p class="i6">By dint of abuse would render them wiser,</p>
<p class="i6">More active and able; and briefly that they</p>
<p class="i6">Must finally prosper and carry the day."</p>
<p class="i6">Now mark the Laced&aelig;monian guile!</p>
<p class="i6">Demanding an insignificant isle!</p>
<p class="i6">"&AElig;gina," they say, "for a pledge of peace,</p>
<p class="i6">As a means to make all jealousy cease."</p>
<p class="i6">Meanwhile their privy design and plan</p>
<p class="i6">Is solely to gain this marvelous man--</p>
<p class="i6">Knowing his influence on your fate--</p>
<p class="i6">By obtaining a hold on his estate</p>
<p class="i6">Situate in the isle aforesaid.</p>
<p class="i6">Therefore there needs to be no more said.</p>
<p class="i5">You know their intention, and know that you know
it:</p>
<p class="i5">You'll keep to your island, and stick to the
poet.</p>
<p class="i9">And he for his part</p>
<p class="i9">Will practice his art</p>
<p class="i9">With a patriot heart,</p>
<p class="i9">With the honest views</p>
<p class="i9">That he now pursues,</p>
<p class="i8">And fair buffoonery and abuse:</p>
<p class="i6">Not rashly bespattering, or basely beflattering,</p>
<p class="i6">Not pimping, or puffing, or acting the ruffian;</p>
<p class="i9">Not sneaking or fawning;</p>
<p class="i9">But openly scorning</p>
<p class="i9">All menace and warning,</p>
<p class="i9">All bribes and suborning:</p>
<p class="i5">He will do his endeavor on your behalf;</p>
<p class="i5">He will teach you to think, he will teach you to
laugh.</p>
<p class="i8">So Cleon again and again may try;</p>
<p class="i8">I value him not, nor fear him, I!</p>
<p class="i8">His rage and rhetoric I defy.</p>
<p class="i8">His impudence, his politics,</p>
<p class="i8">His dirty designs, his rascally tricks,</p>
<p class="i8">No stain of abuse on me shall fix.</p>
<p class="i8">Justice and right, in his despite,</p>
<p class="i6">Shall aid and attend me, and do me right:</p>
<p class="i6">With these to friend, I ne'er will bend,</p>
<p class="i9">Nor descend</p>
<p class="i9">To a humble tone</p>
<p class="i9">(Like his own),</p>

<div class="stanza">
<p>From 'The Birds': Swinburne's Translation</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>Come on then, ye dwellers by nature in darkness, and like to the
leaves' generations,</p>
<p>That are little of might, that are molded of mire, unenduring
and shadowlike nations,</p>
<p>Poor plumeless ephemerals, comfortless mortals, as visions of
shadows fast fleeing,</p>
<p>Lift up your mind unto us that are deathless, and dateless the
date of our being;</p>
<p>Us, children of heaven, us, ageless for aye, us, all of whose
thoughts are eternal:</p>
<p>That ye may from henceforth, having heard of us all things
aright as to matters supernal,</p>
<p>Of the being of birds, and beginning of gods, and of streams,
and the dark beyond reaching,</p>
<p>Trustfully knowing aright, in my name bid Prodicus pack with his
preaching!</p>
<p>It was Chaos and Night at the first, and the blackness of
darkness, and Hell's broad border,</p>
<p>Earth was not, nor air, neither heaven; when in depths of the
womb of the dark without order</p>
<p>First thing, first-born of the black-plumed Night, was a
wind-egg hatched in her bosom,</p>
<p>Whence timely with seasons revolving again sweet Love burst out
as a blossom,</p>
<p>Gold wings glittering forth of his back, like whirlwinds gustily
turning.</p>
<p>He, after his wedlock with Chaos, whose wings are of darkness,
in Hell broad-burning,</p>
<p>For his nestlings begat him the race of us first, and upraised
us to light new-lighted.</p>
<p>And before this was not the race of the gods, until all things
by Love were united:</p>
<p>And of kind united in kind with communion of nature the sky and
the sea are</p>
<p>Brought forth, and the earth, and the race of the gods
everlasting and blest. So that we are</p>
<p>Far away the most ancient of all things blest. And that we are
of Love's generation</p>
<p>There are manifest manifold signs. We have wings, and with us
have the Loves habitation;</p>
<p>And manifold fair young folk that forswore love once, ere the
bloom of them ended,</p>
<p>Have the men that pursued and desired them subdued by the help
of us only befriended,</p>
<p>With such baits as a quail, a flamingo, a goose, or a cock's
comb staring and splendid.</p>
<p>All best good things that befall men come from us birds, as is
plain to all reason:</p>
<p>For first we proclaim and make known to them spring, and the
winter and autumn in season;</p>
<p>Bid sow, when the crane starts clanging for Afric in
shrill-voiced emigrant number,</p>
<p>And calls to the pilot to hang up his rudder again for the
season and slumber;</p>
<p>And then weave a cloak for Orestes the thief, lest he strip men
of theirs if it freezes.</p>
<p>And again thereafter the kite reappearing announces a change in
the breezes.</p>
<p>And that here is the season for shearing your sheep of their
spring wool. Then does the swallow</p>
<p>Give you notice to sell your great-coat, and provide something
light for the heat that's to follow.</p>
<p>Thus are we as Ammon or Delphi unto you. Dodona, nay, Phoebus
Apollo.</p>
<p>For, as first ye come all to get auguries of birds, even such is
in all things your carriage,</p>
<p>Be the matter a matter of trade, or of earning your bread, or of
any one's marriage.</p>
<p>And all things ye lay to the charge of a bird that belong to
discerning prediction:</p>
<p>Winged fame is a bird, as you reckon; you sneeze, and the sign's
as a bird for conviction;</p>
<p>All tokens are "birds" with you--sounds, too, and lackeys and
donkeys. Then must it not follow</p>
<p>That we are to you all as the manifest godhead that speaks in
prophetic Apollo?</p>

With blades just springing from the soil that only ask a shower

Till some worthy neighbor calling, cheers you with his hearty
voice.<br>
Well, with weather such as this, let us hear, Tryg&aelig;us tell
us<br>
What should you and I be doing? You're the king of us good
fellows.<br>
Since it pleases heaven to prosper your endeavors, friend, and
mine,<br>
Let us have a merry meeting, with some friendly talk and wine.<br>
In the vineyard there's your lout, hoeing in the slop and mud--<br>
Send the wench and call him out, this weather he can do no
good.<br>
Dame, take down two pints of meal, and do some fritters in your
way;<br>
Boil some grain and stir it in, and let us have those figs, I
say.<br>
Send a servant to my house,--any one that you can spare,--<br>
Let him fetch a beestings pudding, two gherkins, and the pies of
hare:<br>
There should be four of them in all, if the cat has left them
right;<br>
We heard her racketing and tearing round the larder all last
night,<br>
Boy, bring three of them to us,--take the other to my father:<br>
Cut some myrtle for our garlands, sprigs in flower or blossoms
rather.<br>
Give a shout upon the way to Charinades our neighbor,<br>
To join our drinking bout to-day, since heaven is pleased to bless
our labor.</blockquote>

[<i>Enter Messenger, quite out of breath, and speaking in short
snatches</i>.]<br>
<br>
<i>Messenger</i>--Where is he? Where? Where is he? Where? Where<br>
is he?--The president Peisthetairus?<br>
<br>
<i>Peisthetairus [coolly</i>]--Here am I.<br>
<br>
<i>Mess. [in a gasp of breath</i>]--Your fortification's
finished.<br>
<br>
<i>Peis</i>.--Well! that's well.<br>
<br>
<i>Mess</i>.--A most amazing, astonishing work it is!<br>
So that Theagenes and Proxenides<br>
Might flourish and gasconade and prance away<br>
Quite at their ease, both of them four-in-hand,<br>
Driving abreast upon the breadth of wall,<br>
Each in his own new chariot.<br>
<br>
<i>Peis</i>.--You surprise me.<br>
<br>
<i>Mess</i>.--And the height (for I made the measurement
myself)<br>
Is exactly a hundred fathoms.<br>
<br>
<i>Peis</i>.--Heaven and earth!<br>
How could it be? such a mass! who could have built it?<br>
<br>
<i>Mess</i>.--The Birds; no creature else, no foreigners,<br>
Egyptian bricklayers, workmen or masons.<br>
But they themselves, alone, by their own efforts,--<br>
(Even to my surprise, as an eye-witness)<br>
The Birds, I say, completed everything:<br>
There came a body of thirty thousand cranes,<br>
(I won't be positive, there might be more)<br>
With stones from Africa in their craws and gizzards,<br>
Which the stone-curlews and stone-chatterers<br>
Worked into shape and finished. The sand-martens<br>
And mud-larks, too, were busy in their department,<br>
Mixing the mortar, while the water-birds,<br>
As fast as it was wanted, brought the water<br>
To temper and work it.<br>
<br>
<i>Peis. [in a fidget</i>]--But who served the masons<br>
Who did you get to carry it?<br>
<br>
<i>Mess</i>.--To carry it?<br>
Of course, the carrion crows and carrying pigeons.<br>
<br>
<i>Peis. [in a fuss, which he endeavors to conceal</i>]--<br>
Yes! yes! but after all, to load your hods,<br>
How did you manage that?<br>
<br>
<i>Mess</i>.--Oh, capitally,<br>
I promise you. There were the geese, all barefoot<br>
Trampling the mortar, and when all was ready<br>
They handed it into the hods, so cleverly,<br>
With their flat feet!<br>
<br>
<i>Peis. [a bad joke, as a vent for irritation</i>]--<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They
footed it, you mean--<br>
Come; it was handily done though, I confess.<br>
<br>
<i>Mess</i>.--Indeed, I assure you, it was a sight to see them;<br>
And trains of ducks there were, clambering the ladders<br>
With their duck legs, like bricklayers' 'prentices,<br>
All dapper and handy, with their little trowels.<br>
<br>
<i>Peis</i>.--In fact, then, it's no use engaging foreigners;<br>
Mere folly and waste, we've all within ourselves.<br>
Ah, well now, come! But about the woodwork? Heh!<br>
Who were the carpenters? Answer me that!<br>
<br>
<i>Mess</i>.--The woodpeckers, of course: and there they were,<br>
Laboring upon the gates, driving and banging,<br>
With their hard hatchet-beaks, and such a din,<br>
Such a clatter, as they made, hammering and hacking,<br>
In a perpetual peal, pelting away<br>
Like shipwrights, hard at work in the arsenal.<br>
And now their work is finished, gates and all,<br>
Staples and bolts, and bars and everything;<br>
The sentries at their posts; patrols appointed;<br>
The watchman in the barbican; the beacons<br>
Ready prepared for lighting; all their signals<br>
Arranged--but I'll step out, just for a moment,<br>
To wash my hands. You'll settle all the rest.<br>

<p>[The point of the following selection lies in the monotony of
both narrative style and metre in Euripides's prologues, and

<h2><a name="ARISTOTLE"></a>ARISTOTLE</h2>
<h3>(B.C. 384-322)</h3>
<h3>BY THOMAS DAVIDSON</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he "Stagirite," called by Eusebius "Nature's private secretary,"
and by Dante "the master of those that know,"--the greatest thinker
of the ancient world, and the most influential of all time,--was
born of Greek parents at Stagira, in the mountains of Macedonia, in
B.C. 384. Of his mother, Ph&aelig;stis, almost nothing is known.
His father, Nicomachus, belonged to a medical family, and acted as
private physician to Amyntas, grandfather of Alexander the Great;
whence it is probable that Aristotle's boyhood was passed at or
near the Macedonian court. Losing both his parents while a mere
boy, he was taken charge of by a relative, Proxenus Atarneus, and
sent, at the age of seventeen, to Athens to study. Here he entered
the school of Plato, where he remained twenty years, as pupil and
as teacher. During this time he made the acquaintance of the
leading contemporary thinkers, read omnivorously, amassed an amount
of knowledge that seems almost fabulous, schooled himself in
systematic thought, and (being well off) collected a library,
perhaps the first considerable private library in the world. Having
toward the end felt obliged to assume an independent attitude in
thought, he was not at the death of Plato (347) appointed his
successor in the Academy, as might have been expected. Not wishing
at that time to set up a rival school, he retired to the court of a
former fellow-pupil, Hermias, then king of Assos and Atarneus, whom
he greatly respected, and whose adopted daughter, Pythias, he later
married. Here he remained, pursuing his studies, for three years;
and left only when his patron was treacherously murdered by the
Persians.</p>
<p>Having retired to Mitylene, he soon afterward received an
invitation from Philip of Macedonia to undertake the education of
his son Alexander, then thirteen years old. Aristotle willingly
obeyed this summons; and retiring with his royal pupil to Mieza, a
town southwest of Pella, imparted his instruction in the
Nymph&aelig;um, which he had arranged in imitation of Plato's
garden school. Alexander remained with him three years, and was
then called by his father to assume important State duties. Whether
Aristotle's instruction continued after that is uncertain; but the
two men remained fast friends, and there can be no doubt that much
of the nobility, self-control, largeness of purpose, and enthusiasm
for culture, which characterized Alexander's subsequent career,
were due to the teaching of the philosopher. What Aristotle was in
the world of thought, Alexander became in the world of action.</p>
<a name="illus0788.jpg"></a><br>
<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illus0788.jpg" width="50%" alt=
""></p>
<br>
<p>Aristotle remained in Macedonia ten years, giving instruction to
young Macedonians and continuing his own studies. He then returned
to Athens, and opened a school in the <i>peripatos</i>, or
promenade, of the Lyceum, the gymnasium of the foreign residents, a
school which from its location was called the Peripatetic. Here he
developed a manifold activity. He pursued all kinds of studies,
logical, rhetorical, physical, metaphysical, ethical, political,
and aesthetic, gave public (exoteric) and private (esoteric)
instruction, and composed the bulk of the treatises which have made
his name famous. These treatises were composed slowly, in
connection with his lectures, and subjected to frequent revision.
He likewise endeavored to lead an ideal social life with his
friends and pupils, whom he gathered under a common roof to share
meals and elevated converse in common.</p>
<p>Thus affairs went on for twelve fruitful years, and might have
gone on longer, but for the sudden death of Alexander, his friend
and patron. Then the hatred of the Athenians to the conqueror
showed itself in hostility to his old master, and sought for means
to put him out of the way. How hard it was to find a pretext for so
doing is shown by the fact that they had to fix upon the poem which
he had written on the death of his friend Hermias many years
before, and base upon it--as having the form of the paean, sacred
to Apollo--a charge of impiety. Aristotle, recognizing the utter
flimsiness of the charge, and being unwilling, as he said, to allow
the Athenians to sin a second time against philosophy, retired
beyond their reach to his villa at Chalcis in Euboea, where he died
of stomach disease the year after (322). In the later years of his
life, the friendship between him and his illustrious pupil had,
owing to certain outward circumstances, become somewhat cooled; but
there never was any serious breach. His body was carried to
Stagira, which he had induced Philip to restore after it had been
destroyed, and whose inhabitants therefore looked upon him as the
founder of the city. As such he received the religious honors
accorded to heroes: an altar was erected to him, at which an annual
festival was celebrated in the month named after him.</p>
<p>We may sum up the character of Aristotle by saying that he was
one of the sanest and most rounded men that ever lived. As a
philosopher, he stands in the front rank. "No time," says Hegel,
"has a man to place by his side." Nor was his moral character
inferior to his intellect. No one can read his 'Ethics,' or his
will (the text of which is extant), without feeling the nobleness,
simplicity, purity, and modernness of his nature. In his family
relations, especially, he seems to have stood far above his
contemporaries. The depth of his aesthetic perception is attested
by his poems and his 'Poetics.'</p>
<p>The unsatisfactory and fragmentary condition in which
Aristotle's works have come down to us makes it difficult to judge
of his style. Many of them seem mere collections of notes and
jottings for lectures, without any attempt at style. The rest are
distinguished by brevity, terseness, and scientific precision. No
other man ever enriched philosophic language with so many original
expressions. We know, from the testimony of most competent judges,
such as Cicero, that his popular writings, dialogues, etc., were
written in an elegant style, casting even that of Plato into the
shade; and this is borne fully out by some extant fragments.</p>
<p>Greek philosophy culminates in Aristotle. Setting out with a
na&iuml;ve acceptance of the world as being what it seemed, and
trying to reduce this Being to some material principle, such as
water, air, etc., it was gradually driven, by force of logic, to
distinguish Being from Seeming, and to see that while the latter
was dependent on the thinking subject, the former could not be
anything material. This result was reached by both the
materialistic and spiritualistic schools, and was only carried one
step further by the Sophists, who maintained that even the being of
things depended on the thinker. This necessarily led to skepticism,
individualism, and disruption of the old social and religious
order.</p>
<p>Then arose Socrates, greatest of the Sophists, who, seeing that
the outer world had been shown to depend on the inner, adopted as
his motto, "Know Thyself," and devoted himself to the study of
mind. By his dialectic method he showed that skepticism and
individualism, so far as anarchic, can be overcome by carrying out
thought to its implications; when it proves to be the same for all,
and to bring with it an authority binding on all, and replacing
that of the old external gods. Thus Socrates discovered the
principle of human liberty, a principle necessarily hostile to the
ancient State, which absorbed the man in the citizen. Socrates was
accordingly put to death as an atheist; and then Plato, with good
intentions but prejudiced insight, set to work to restore the old
tyranny of the State. This he did by placing truth, or reality
(which Socrates had found in complete thought, internal to the
mind), outside of both thought and nature, and making it consist of
a group of eternal schemes, or forms, of which natural things are
merely transient phantoms, and which can be reached by only a few
aristocratic souls, born to rule the rest. On the basis of this
distortion he constructed his Republic, in which complete despotism
is exercised by the philosophers through the military; man is
reduced to a machine, his affections and will being disregarded;
community of women and of property is the law; and science is
scouted.</p>
<p>Aristotle's philosophy may be said to be a protest against this
view, and an attempt to show that reality is embodied in nature,
which depends on a supreme intelligence, and may be realized in
other intelligences, or thought-centres, such as the human mind. In
other words, according to Aristotle, truth is actual in the world
and potential in all minds, which may by experience put on its
forms. Thus the individualism of the Sophists and the despotism of
Plato are overcome, while an important place is made for
experience, or science.</p>
<p>Aristotle, accepting the world of common-sense, tried to
rationalize it; that is, to realize it in himself. First among the
Greeks he believed it to be unique, uncreated, and eternal, and
gave his reasons. Recognizing that the phenomenal world exists in
change, he investigated the principle and method of this. Change he
conceives as a transition from potentiality to actuality, and as
always due to something actualized, communicating its form to
something potential. Looking at the "world" as a whole, and
picturing it as limited, globular, and constructed like an onion,
with the earth in the centre, and round about it nine concentric
spheres carrying the planets and stars, he concludes that there
must be at one end something purely actual and therefore
unchanging,--that is, pure form or energy; and at the other,
something purely potential and therefore changing,--that is, pure
matter or latency. The pure actuality is at the circumference, pure
matter at the centre. Matter, however, never exists without some
form. Thus, nature is an eternal circular process between the
actual and the potential. The supreme Intelligence, God, being pure
energy, changelessly thinks himself, and through the love inspired
by his perfection moves the outmost sphere; which would move all
the rest were it not for inferior intelligences, fifty-six in
number, who, by giving them different directions, diversify the
divine action and produce the variety of the world. The celestial
world is composed of eternal matter, or aether, whose only change
is circular motion; the sublunary world is composed of changing
matter, in four different but mutually transmutable forms--fire,
air, water, earth--movable in two opposite directions, in straight
lines, under the ever-varying influence of the celestial
spheres.</p>
<p>Thus the world is an organism, making no progress as a whole,
but continually changing in its various parts. In it all real
things are individuals, not universals, as Plato thought. And forms
pass from individual to individual only. Peleus, not humanity, is
the parent of Achilles; the learned man only can teach the
ignorant. In the world-process there are several distinct stages,
to each of which Aristotle devotes a special work, or series of
works. Beginning with the "four elements" and their changes, he
works up through the mineral, vegetable, and animal worlds, to man,
and thence through the spheral intelligences to the supreme, divine
intelligence, on which the Whole depends. Man stands on the
dividing line between the temporal and the eternal; belonging with
his animal part to the former, with his intelligence (which "enters
from without") to the latter. He is an intelligence, of the same
nature as the sphere-movers, but individuated by mutable matter in
the form of a body, matter being in all cases the principle of
individuation. As intelligence, he becomes free; takes the guidance
of his life into his own hand; and, first through ethics, politics,
and aesthetics, the forms of his sensible or practical activity,
and second through logic, science, and philosophy, the forms of his
intellectual activity, he rises to divine heights and "plays the
immortal." His supreme activity is contemplation. This, the eternal
energy of God, is possible for man only at rare intervals.</p>
<p>Aristotle, by placing his eternal forms in sensible things as
their meaning, made science possible and necessary. Not only is he
the father of scientific method, inductive and deductive, but his
actual contributions to science place him in the front rank of
scientists. His Zo&ouml;logy, Psychology, Logic, Metaphysics,
Ethics, Politics, and Aesthetics, are still highly esteemed and
extensively studied. At the same time, by failing to overcome the
dualism and supernaturalism of Plato, by adopting the popular
notions about spheres and sphere-movers, by separating intelligence
from sense, by conceiving matter as independent and the principle
of individuation, and by making science relate only to the
universal, he paved the way for astrology, alchemy, magic, and all
the forms of superstition, retarding the advance of several
sciences, as for example astronomy and chemistry, for many hundred
years.</p>
<p>After Aristotle's death, his school was continued by a
succession of studious and learned men, but did not for many
centuries deeply affect contemporary life. At last, in the fifth
century A.D., his thought found its way into the Christian schools,
giving birth to rationalism and historical criticism. At various
times its adherents were condemned as heretics and banished, mostly
to Syria. Here, at Edessa and Nisibis, they established schools of
learning which for several centuries were the most famous in the
world. The entire works of Aristotle were turned into Syriac; among
them several spurious ones of Neo-Platonic origin, notably the
famous 'Liber de Causis' and the 'Theology of Aristotle.' Thus a
Neo-Platonic Aristotle came to rule Eastern learning. On the rise
of Isl&acirc;m, this Aristotle was borrowed by the Muslims, and
became ruler of their schools at Bagdad, Basra, and other
places,--schools which produced many remarkable men. On the decay
of these, he passed in the twelfth century into the schools of
Spain, and here ruled supreme until Arab philosophy was suppressed,
shortly before 1200. From the Arabs he passed into the Christian
Church about this date; and though at first resisted, was finally
accepted, and became "the philosopher" of the schools, and the
inspirer of Dante. The Reformers, though decrying him, were forced
to have recourse to him; but his credit was not re-established
until the present century, when, thanks to Hegel, Trendelenburg,
Brandis, and the Berlin Academy, his true value was recognized and
his permanent influence insured.</p>
<p>The extant works of Aristotle, covering the whole field of
science, may be classified as follows:--</p>
<p>A. <i>Logical or Formal</i>, dealing with the form rather than
the matter of science:--'Categories,' treating of Being and its
determination, which, being regarded ontologically, bring the work
into the metaphysical sphere; 'On Interpretation,' dealing with the
proposition; 'Former Analytics,' theory of the syllogism; 'Later
Analytics,' theory of proof; 'Topics,' probable proofs;
'Sophistical proofs,' fallacies. These works were later united by
the Stoics under the title 'Organon,' or Instrument (of
science).</p>
<p>B. <i>Scientific or Philosophical</i>, dealing with the matter
of science. These may be subdivided into three classes: (<i>a</i>)
Theoretical, (<i>b</i>) Practical, (<i>c</i>) Creative.</p>
<p>(<i>a</i>) The <i>Theoretical</i> has further subdivisions:
(<i>a</i>) Metaphysical, (<i>b</i>) Physical, (<i>c</i>)
Mathematical.--(<i>a</i>) The Metaphysical works include the
incomplete collection under the name 'Metaphysics,'--(<i>b</i>) The
Physical works include 'Physics,' 'On the Heavens,' 'On Generation
and Decay,' 'On the Soul,' with eight supplementary tracts on
actions of the soul as combined with the body; viz., 'On Sense and
Sensibles,' 'On Memory and Reminiscence,' 'On Sleep and Waking,'
'On Dreams,' 'On Divination from Dreams,' 'On Length and Shortness
of Life,' 'On Life and Death,' 'On Respiration,' 'Meteorologics,'
'Histories of Animals' (Zo&ouml;graphy). 'On the Parts of Animals,'
'On the Generation of Animals,' 'On the Motion of Animals,'
'Problems' (largely spurious). 'On the Cosmos,' 'Physiognomies,'
'On Wonderful Auditions,' 'On Colors.'--The Mathematical works
include 'On Indivisible Lines,' 'Mechanics.'</p>
<p>(<i>b</i>) The <i>Practical</i> works are 'Nicomachean Ethics,'
'Endemean Ethics,' 'Great Ethics' ('Magna Moralia'), really
different forms of the same work; 'Politics,' 'Constitutions'
(originally one hundred and fifty-eight in number; now represented
only by the recently discovered 'Constitution of Athens'), 'On
Virtues and Vices,' 'Rhetoric to Alexander,' 'Oeconomics.'</p>
<p>(<i>c</i>) Of <i>Creative</i> works we have only the fragmentary
'Poetics.' To these may be added a few poems, one of which is given
here.</p>
<p>Besides the extant works of Aristotle, we have titles,
fragments, and some knowledge of the contents of a large number
more. Among these are the whole of the "exoteric" works, including
nineteen Dialogues. A list of his works, as arranged in the
Alexandrian Library (apparently), is given by Diogenes
La&euml;rtius in his 'Life of Aristotle' (printed in the Berlin and
Paris editions of 'Aristotle'); a list in which it is not easy to
identify the whole of the extant works. The 'Fragments' appear in
both the editions just named. Some of the works named above are
almost certainly spurious; <i>e.g.</i>, the 'Rhetoric to
Alexander,' the 'Oeconomics,' etc.</p>
<p>The chief editions of Aristotle's works, exclusive of the
'Constitution of Athens,' are that of the Berlin Academy (Im.
Bekker), containing text, scholia, Latin translation, and Index in
Greek (5 vols., square 4to); and the Paris or Didot (D&uuml;bner,
Bussemaker, Heitz), containing text, Latin translation, and very
complete Index in Latin (5 vols., 4to). Of the chief works the best
editions are:--'Organon,' Waitz; 'Metaphysics,' Schwegler, Bonitz;
'Physics,' Prantl; 'Meteorologies,' Ideler; 'On the Generation of
Animals,' Aubert and Wimmer; 'Psychology,' Trendelenburg, Torstrik,
Wallace (with English translation); 'Nicomachean Ethics,' Grant,
Ramsauer, Susemihl; 'Politics,' Stahr, Susemihl; 'Constitution of
Athens,' Kenyon, Sandys; 'Poetics,' Susemihl, Vahlen, Butcher (with
English translation). There are few good English translations of
Aristotle's works; but among these may be mentioned Peter's
'Nicomachean Ethics,' Jowett's and Welldon's 'Politics,' and
Poste's 'Constitution of Athens.' There is a fair French
translation of the principal works by Barth&eacute;lemy
St.-Hilaire. The Berlin Academy is now (1896) publishing the
ancient Greek commentaries on Aristotle in thirty-five quarto
volumes. The best work on Aristotle is that by E. Zeller, in Vol.
iii. of his 'Philosophie der Griechen.' The English works by Lewes
and Grote are inferior. For Bibliography, the student may consult

<h2><a name="THE_NATURE_OF_THE_SOUL"></a>THE NATURE OF THE
SOUL</h2>
<center>From 'On the Soul,' Book iii., Chapter 6</center>
<br>
<p>Concerning that part of the soul, however, by which the soul
knows (and is prudentially wise) whether it is separable or not
separable, according to magnitude, but according to reason, it must
be considered what difference it possesses, and how intellectual
perception is produced. If, therefore, to perceive intellectually
is the same thing as to perceive sensibly, it will either be to
suffer something from the intelligible, or something else of this
kind. It is necessary, however, that it should be impassive, but
capable of receiving form; and in capacity a thing of this kind,
but not this; and also, that as the sensitive power is to
sensibles, so should intellect be to intelligibles. It is
necessary, therefore, since it understands all things, that it
should be unmingled, as Anaxagoras says, that it may predominate:
but this is that it may know; for that which is foreign at the same
time presenting itself to the view, impedes and obstructs.</p>
<p>Hence, neither is there any other nature of it than this, that
it is possible. That, therefore, which is called the intellect of
soul (I mean the intellect by which the soul energizes
dianoetically and hypoleptically), is nothing in energy of beings
before it intellectually perceives them. Hence, neither is it
reasonable that it should be mingled with body; for thus it would
become a thing with certain quality, would be hot or cold, and
would have a certain organ in the same manner as the sensitive
power. Now, however, there is no organ of it. In a proper manner,
therefore, do they speak, who say that the soul is the place of
forms; except that this is not true of the whole soul, but of that
which is intellective; nor is it forms in entelecheia, but in
capacity. But that the impassivity of the sensitive and
intellective power is not similar, is evident in the sensoria and
in sense. For sense cannot perceive from a vehement sensible object
(as for instance, sounds from very loud sounds; nor from strong
odors and colors can it either see or smell): but intellect, when
it understands anything very intelligible, does not less understand
inferior concerns, but even understands them in a greater degree;
for the sensitive power is not without body, but intellect is
separate from body.</p>
<p>When however it becomes particulars, in such a manner as he is
said to possess scientific knowledge who scientifically knows in
energy (and this happens when it is able to energize through
itself), then also it is similarly in a certain respect in
capacity, yet not after the same manner as before it learnt or
discovered; and it is then itself able to understand itself. By the
sensitive power, therefore, it distinguishes the hot and the cold,
and those things of which flesh is a certain reason; but by another
power, either separate, or as an inflected line subsists with
reference to itself when it is extended, it distinguishes the
essence of flesh. Further still, in those things which consist in
ablation, the straight is as the flat nose; for it subsists with
the continued.</p>
<p>Some one, however, may question, if intellect is simple and
impassive and has nothing in common with anything, as Anaxagoras
says, how it can perceive intellectually, if to perceive
intellectually is to suffer something; for so far as something is
common to both, the one appears to act, but the other to suffer.
Again, it may also be doubted whether intellect is itself
intelligible. For either intellect will also be present with other
things, if it is not intelligible according to another thing, but
the intelligible is one certain thing in species; or it will have
something mingled, which will make it to be intelligible in the
same manner as other things. Or shall we say that to suffer
subsists according to something common? On which account, it was
before observed that intellect is in capacity, in a certain
respect, intelligibles, but is no one of them in entelecheia,
before it understands or perceives intellectually. But it is
necessary to conceive of it as of a table in which nothing is
written in entelecheia; which happens to be the case in intellect.
But in those things which have matter, each of the intelligibles is
in capacity only. Hence, intellect will not be present with them;
for the intellect of such things is capacity without matter. But
with intellect the intelligible will be present.</p>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<p>Since, however, in every nature there is something which is
matter to each genus (and this because it is all those in
capacity), and something which is the cause and affective, because
it produces all things (in such a manner as art is affected with
respect to matter), it is necessary that these differences should
also be inherent in the soul. And the one is an intellect of this
kind because it becomes all things; but the other because it
produces all things as a certain habit, such for instance as light.
For in a certain respect, light also causes colors which are in
capacity to be colors in energy. And this intellect is separate,
unmingled, and impassive, since it is in its essence energy; for
the efficient is always more honorable than the patient, and the
principle than matter. Science, also, in energy is the same as the
thing [which is scientifically known]. But science which is in
capacity is prior in time in the one [to science in energy];
though, in short, neither [is capacity prior to energy] in time. It
does not, however, perceive intellectually at one time and at
another time not, but separate intellect is alone this very thing
which it is; and this alone is immortal and eternal. We do not,
however, remember because this is impassive; but the passive
intellect is corruptible, and without this the separate intellect
understands nothing.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_THE_DIFFERENCE_BETWEEN_HISTORY_AND_POETRY"></a>ON
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HISTORY AND POETRY, AND<br>
HOW HISTORICAL MATTER SHOULD BE USED IN POETRY</h2>
<center>From the 'Poetics,' Chapter 9</center>
<br>
<p>But it is evident from what has been said that it is not the
province of a poet to relate things which have happened, but such
as might have happened, and such things as are possible according
to probability, or which would necessarily have happened. For a
historian and a poet do not differ from each other because the one
writes in verse and the other in prose; for the history of
Herodotus might be written in verse, and yet it would be no less a
history with metre than without metre. But they differ in this,
that the one speaks of things which have happened, and the other of
such as might have happened. Hence, poetry is more philosophic, and
more deserving of attention, than history. For poetry speaks more
of universals, but history of particulars. But universal consists,
indeed, in relating or performing certain things which happen to a
man of a certain description, either probably or necessarily [to
which the aim of poetry is directed in giving names]; but
particular consists in narrating what [for example] Alcibiades did,
or what he suffered. In comedy, therefore, this is now become
evident. For comic poets having composed a fable through things of
a probable nature, they thus give whatever names they please to
their characters, and do not, like iambic poets, write poems about
particular persons. But in tragedy they cling to real names. The
cause, however, of this is, that the possible is credible. Things
therefore which have not yet been done, we do not yet believe to be
possible: but it is evident that things which have been done are
possible, for they would not have been done if they were
impossible.</p>
<p>Not indeed but that in some tragedies there are one or two known
names, and the rest are feigned; but in others there is no known
name, as for instance in 'The Flower of Agatho.' For in this
tragedy the things and the names are alike feigned, and yet it
delights no less. Hence, one must not seek to adhere entirely to
traditional fables, which are the subjects of tragedy. For it is
ridiculous to make this the object of search, because even known
subjects are known but to a few, though at the same time they
delight all men. From these things, therefore, it is evident that a
poet ought rather to be the author of fables than of metres,
inasmuch as he is a poet from imitation, and he imitates actions.
Hence, though it should happen that he relates things which have
happened, he is no less a poet. For nothing hinders but that some
actions which have happened are such as might both probably and
possibly have happened, and by [the narration of] such he is a
poet.</p>
<p>But of simple plots and actions, the episodic are the worst. But
I call the plot episodic, in which it is neither probable nor
necessary that the episodes follow each other. Such plots, however,
are composed by bad poets, indeed, through their own want of
ability; but by good poets, on account of the players. For,
introducing [dramatic] contests, and extending the plot beyond its
capabilities, they are frequently compelled to distort the
connection of the parts. But tragedy is not only an imitation of a
perfect action, but also of actions which are terrible and piteous,
and actions principally become such (and in a greater degree when
they happen contrary to opinion) on account of each other. For thus
they will possess more of the marvelous than if they happened from
chance and fortune; since also of things which are from fortune,
those appear to be most admirable which seem to happen as it were
by design. Thus the statue of Mityus at Argos killed him who was
the cause of the death of Mityus by falling as he was surveying it.
For such events as these seem not to take place casually. Hence it
is necessary that fables of this kind should be more beautiful.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="ON_PHILOSOPHY"></a>ON PHILOSOPHY</h2>
<center>Quoted in Cicero's 'Nature of the Gods'</center>
<br>
<p>If there were men whose habitations had been always under
ground, in great and commodious houses, adorned with statues and
pictures, furnished with everything which they who are reputed
happy abound with: and if, without stirring from thence, they
should be informed of a certain divine power and majesty, and after
some time the earth should open and they should quit their dark
abode to come to us, where they should immediately behold the
earth, the seas, the heavens; should consider the vast extent of
the clouds and force of the winds; should see the sun and observe
his grandeur and beauty, and perceive that day is occasioned by the
diffusion of his light through the sky; and when night has obscured
the earth they should contemplate the heavens, bespangled and
adorned with stars, the surprising variety of the moon in her
increase and wane, the rising and setting of all the stars and the
inviolable regularity of their courses,--when, says he, "they
should see these things, they would undoubtedly conclude that there
are gods, and that these are their mighty works."</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="ON_ESSENCES"></a>ON ESSENCES</h2>
<center>From 'The Metaphysics,' Book xi., Chapter I</center>
<br>
<p>The subject of theory (or speculative science) is
<i>essence</i>. In it are investigated the principles and causes of
essences. The truth is, if the All be regarded as a whole, essence
is its first (or highest) part. Also, if we consider the natural
order of the categories, essence stands at the head of the list;
then comes quality; then quantity. It is true that the other
categories, such as qualities and movements, are not in any
absolute sense at all, and the same is true of [negatives, such as]
not-white or not-straight. Nevertheless, we use such expressions as
"Not-white is."</p>
<p>Moreover, no one of the other categories is separable [or
independent]. This is attested by the procedure of the older
philosophers; for it was the principles, elements, and causes of
essence that were the objects of their investigations. The thinkers
of the present day, to be sure, are rather inclined to consider
universals as essence. For genera are universals, and these they
hold to be principles and essences, mainly because their mode of
investigation is a logical one. The older philosophers, on the
other hand, considered particular things to be essences;
<i>e.g.,</i> fire and earth, not body in general.</p>
<p>There are three essences. Two of these are sensible, one being
eternal and the other transient. The latter is obvious to all, in
the form of plants and animals; with regard to the former, there is
room for discussion, as to whether its elements are one or many.
The third, differing from the other two, is immutable and is
maintained by certain persons to be separable. Some make two
divisions of it, whereas others class together, as of one nature,
ideas and mathematical entities; and others again admit only the
latter. The first two essences belong to physical science, for they
are subject to change; the last belongs to another science, if
there is no principle common to all.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="ON_COMMUNITY_OF_STUDIES"></a>ON COMMUNITY OF
STUDIES</h2>
<center>From 'The Politics,' Book 8</center>
<br>
<p>No one, therefore, can doubt that the legislator ought
principally to attend to the education of youth. For in cities
where this is neglected, the politics are injured. For every State
ought to be governed according to its nature; since the appropriate
manners of each polity usually preserve the polity, and establish
it from the beginning. Thus, appropriate democratic manners
preserve and establish a democracy, and oligarchic an oligarchy.
Always, however, the best manners are the cause of the best polity.
Further still, in all professions and arts, there are some things
which ought previously to be learnt, and to which it is requisite
to be previously accustomed, in order to the performance of their
several works,; so that it is evident that it is also necessary in
the practice of virtue.</p>
<p>Since, however, there is one purpose to every city, it is
evident that the education must necessarily be one and the same in
all cities; and that the attention paid to this should be common.
At the same time, also, no one ought to think that any person takes
care of the education of his children separately, and privately
teaches them that particular discipline which appears to him to be
proper. But it is necessary that the studies of the public should
be common. At the same time, also, no one ought to think that any
citizen belongs to him in particular, but that all the citizens
belong to the city; for each individual is a part of the city. The
care and attention, however, which are paid to each of the parts,
naturally look to the care and attention of the whole. And for
this, some one may praise the Lacedaemonians; for they pay very
great attention to their children, and this in common. It is
evident, therefore, that laws should be established concerning
education, and that it should be made common.</p>

<h2><a name="JON_ARNASON"></a>J&Oacute;N ARNASON</h2>
<h3>(1819-1888)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-j.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>&oacute;n Arnason was born in 1819, at Hof.
Ak&agrave;gastr&ouml;nd, in Iceland, where his father, Arm
Illugason, was clergyman. After completing the course at the
Bessastad Latin School, at that time the most famous school in
Iceland, he took his first position as librarian of the so-called
Stiptb&oacute;kasafn Islands (since 1881 called the National
Library), which office he held till 1887, when he asked to be
relieved from his official duties. During this period he had been
also the first librarian of the Reykjavik branch of the Icelandic
Literary Society; a teacher and the custodian of the library at the
Latin School, which in the mean time had been moved from Bessastad
to Reykjavik; secretary of the bishop, Helgi Thordersen, and
custodian of the growing collection of Icelandic antiquities which
has formed the nucleus of a national museum. He had found time,
besides, during these years, for considerable literary work; and
apart from several valuable bibliographies had, alone and in
collaboration, made important contributions to his native
literature. He died at Reykjavik in 1888.</p>
<p>His principal literary work, and that by which alone he is known
outside of Iceland, is the collection of folk-tales that appeared
in Iceland in 1862-64, in two volumes, with the title 'Islenzkar
Thoos&ouml;gur og &AElig;fintyri' (Icelandic Popular Legends and
Tales). A small preliminary collection, called 'Islenzk
&AElig;fintyri' (Icelandic Tales), made in collaboration with
Magnus Grimsson, had been published in 1852. Subsequently,
J&oacute;n Arnason went to work single-handed to make an exhaustive
collection of the folk-tales of the country, which by traveling and
correspondence he drew from every nook and corner of Iceland. No
effort was spared to make the collection complete, and many years
were spent in this undertaking. The results were in every way
valuable. No more important collection of folk-tales exists in the
literature of any nation, and the work has become both a classic at
home and a most suggestive link in the comparative study of
folk-lore elsewhere. Arnason thus performed for his native land
what the Grimms did for Germany, and what Asbj&ouml;rnsen and Moe
did for Norway. He has frequently been called the "Grimm of
Iceland." The stories of the collection have since found their way
all over the world, many of them having been translated into
English, German, French, and Danish.</p>
<p>In his transcription of the tales, Arnason has followed, even
more conscientiously, the plan of the Grimms in adhering to the
local or individual form in which the story had come to him in
writing or by oral transmission. We get in this way a perfect
picture of the national spirit, and a better knowledge of life and
environment in Iceland than from any other source. In these stories
there is much to say of elves and trolls, of ghosts and "fetches,"
of outlaws and the devil. Magic plays an important part, and there
is the usual lore of beasts and plants. Many of them are but
variants of folk-tales that belong to the race. Others, however,
are as plainly local evolutions, which in their whole conception
are as weird and mysterious as the environment that has produced
them.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MERMAN"></a>THE MERMAN</h2>
<p>Long ago a farmer lived at Vogar, who was a mighty fisherman;
and of all the farms about, not one was so well situated with
regard to the fisheries as his.</p>
<p>One day, according to custom, he had gone out fishing; and
having cast down his line from the boat and waited awhile, found it
very hard to pull up again, as if there were something very heavy
at the end of it. Imagine his astonishment when he found that what
he had caught was a great fish, with a man's head and body! When he
saw that this creature was alive, he addressed it and said, "Who
and whence are you?"</p>
<p>"A merman from the bottom of the sea," was the reply.</p>
<p>The farmer then asked him what he had been doing when the hook
caught his flesh.</p>
<p>The other replied, "I was turning the cowl of my mother's
chimney-pot, to suit it to the wind. So let me go again, will
you?"</p>
<p>"Not for the present," said the fisherman. "You shall serve me
awhile first." So without more words he dragged him into the boat
and rowed to shore with him.</p>
<p>When they got to the boat-house, the fisherman's dog came to him
and greeted him joyfully, barking and fawning on him, and wagging
his tail. But his master's temper being none of the best, he struck
the poor animal; whereupon the merman laughed for the first
time.</p>
<p>Having fastened the boat, he went toward his house, dragging his
prize with him over the fields, and stumbling over a hillock which
lay in his way, cursed it heartily; whereupon the merman laughed
for the second time.</p>
<p>When the fisherman arrived at the farm, his wife came out to
receive him, and embraced him affectionately, and he received her
salutations with pleasure; whereupon the merman laughed for the
third time.</p>
<p>Then said the farmer to the merman, "You have laughed three
times, and I am curious to know why you have laughed. Tell me,
therefore."</p>
<p>"Never will I tell you," replied the merman, "unless you promise
to take me to the same place in the sea wherefrom you caught me,
and there to let me go free again." So the farmer made him the
promise.</p>
<p>"Well," said the merman, "I laughed the first time because you
struck your dog, whose joy at meeting you was real and sincere. The
second time, because you cursed the mound over which you stumbled,
which is full of golden ducats. And the third time, because you
received with pleasure your wife's empty and flattering embrace,
who is faithless to you, and a hypocrite. And now be an honest man,
and take me out to the sea whence you brought me."</p>
<p>The farmer replied, "Two things that you have told me I have no
means of proving; namely, the faithfulness of my dog and the
faithlessness of my wife. But the third I will try the truth of;
and if the hillock contain gold, then I will believe the rest."</p>
<p>Accordingly he went to the hillock, and having dug it up, found
therein a great treasure of golden ducats, as the merman had told
him. After this the farmer took the merman down to the boat, and to
that place in the sea whence he had brought him. Before he put him
in, the latter said to him:</p>
<p>"Farmer, you have been an honest man, and I will reward you for
restoring me to my mother, if only you have skill enough to take
possession of property that I shall throw in your way. Be happy and
prosper."</p>
<p>Then the farmer put the merman into the sea, and he sank out of
sight.</p>
<p>It happened that not long after seven sea-gray cows were seen on
the beach, close to the farmer's land. These cows appeared to be
very unruly, and ran away directly the farmer approached them. So
he took a stick and ran after them, possessed with the fancy that
if he could burst the bladder which he saw on the nose of each of
them, they would belong to him. He contrived to hit the bladder on
the nose of one cow, which then became so tame that he could easily
catch it, while the others leaped into the sea and disappeared.</p>
<p>The farmer was convinced that this was the gift of the merman.
And a very useful gift it was, for better cow was never seen nor
milked in all the land, and she was the mother of the race of gray
cows so much esteemed now.</p>
<p>And the farmer prospered exceedingly, but never caught any more
mermen. As for his wife, nothing further is told about her, so we
can repeat nothing.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="THE_FISHERMAN_OF_GOTUR"></a>THE FISHERMAN OF
G&Ouml;TUR</h2>
<p>It is told that long ago a peasant living at G&ouml;tur in
Myrdalur went out fishing round the island of Dyrh&oacute;lar. In
returning from the sea, he had to cross a morass. It happened once
that on his way home after nightfall, he came to a place where a
man had lost his horse in the bog, and was unable to recover it
without help. The fisherman, to whom this man was a stranger, aided
him in freeing his horse from the peat.</p>
<p>When the animal stood again safe and sound upon the dry earth,
the stranger said to the fisherman, "I am your neighbor, for I live
in Hvammsgil, and am returning from the sea, like you. But I am so
poor that I cannot pay you for this service as you ought to be
paid. I will promise you, however, this much: that you shall never
go to sea without catching fish, nor ever, if you will take my
advice, return with empty hands. But you must never put to sea
without having first seen me pass your house, as if going toward
the shore. Obey me in this matter, and I promise you that you shall
never launch your boat in vain."</p>
<p>The fisherman thanked him for this advice; and sure enough it
was that for three years afterward, never putting to sea till he
had first seen his neighbor pass his door, he always launched his
boat safely, and always came home full-handed.</p>
<p>But at the end of the three years it fell out that one day in
the early morning, the fisherman, looking out from his house, saw
the wind and weather favorable, and all other fishers hurrying down
to the sea to make the best of so good a time. But though he waited
hour after hour in the hope of seeing his neighbor pass, the man of
Hvammsgil never came. At last, losing his patience, he started out
without having seen him go by. When he came down to the shore, he
found that all the boats were launched and far away.</p>
<p>Before night the wind rose and became a storm, and every boat
that had that day put to sea was wrecked, and every fisher drowned;
the peasant of G&ouml;tur alone escaping, for he had been unable to
go out fishing. The next night he had a strange dream, in which his
neighbor from Hvammsgil came to him and said, "Although you did not
yesterday follow my advice, I yet so far felt kindly toward you
that I hindered you from going out to sea, and saved you thus from
drowning; but look no more forth to see me pass, for we have met
for the last time." And never again did the peasant see his
neighbor pass his door.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="THE_MAGIC_SCYTHE"></a>THE MAGIC SCYTHE</h2>
<p>A certain day-laborer once started from his home in the south to
earn wages for hay-cutting in the north country. In the mountains
he was suddenly overtaken by a thick mist and sleet-storm, and lost
his way. Fearing to go on further, he pitched his tent in a
convenient spot, and taking out his provisions, began to eat.</p>
<p>While he was engaged upon his meal, a brown dog came into the
tent, so ill-favored, dirty, wet, and fierce-eyed, that the poor
man felt quite afraid of it, and gave it as much bread and meat as
it could devour. This the dog swallowed greedily, and ran off again
into the mist. At first the man wondered much to see a dog in such
a wild place, where he never expected to meet with a living
creature; but after a while he thought no more about the matter,
and having finished his supper, fell asleep, with his saddle for a
pillow.</p>
<p>At midnight he dreamed that he saw a tall and aged woman enter
his tent, who spoke thus to him:--"I am beholden to you, good man,
for your kindness to my daughter, but am unable to reward you as
you deserve. Here is a scythe which I place beneath your pillow; it
is the only gift I can make you, but despise it not. It will surely
prove useful to you, as it can cut down all that lies before it.
Only beware of putting it into the fire to temper it. Sharpen it,
however, as you will, but in that way never." So saying, she was
seen no more.</p>
<p>When the man awoke and looked forth, he found the mist all gone
and the sun high in heaven; so getting all his things together and
striking his tent, he laid them upon the pack-horses, saddling last
of all his own horse. But on lifting his saddle from the ground, he
found beneath it a small scythe blade, which seemed well worn and
was rusty. On seeing this, he at once recalled to mind his dream,
and taking the scythe with him, set out once more on his way. He
soon found again the road which he had lost, and made all speed to
reach the well-peopled district to which he was bound.</p>
<p>When he arrived at the north country, he went from house to
house, but did not find any employment, for every farmer had
laborers enough, and one week of hay-harvest was already past. He
heard it said, however, that one old woman in the district,
generally thought by her neighbors to be skilled in magic and very
rich, always began her hay-cutting a week later than anybody else,
and though she seldom employed a laborer, always contrived to
finish it by the end of the season. When by any chance--and it was
a rare one--she did engage a workman, she was never known to pay
him for his work.</p>
<p>Now the peasant from the south was advised to ask this old woman
for employment, having been warned of her strange habits.</p>
<p>He accordingly went to her house, and offered himself to her as
a day laborer. She accepted his offer, and told him that he might,
if he chose, work a week for her, but must expect no payment.</p>
<p>"Except," she said, "you can cut more grass in the whole week
than I can rake in on the last day of it."</p>
<p>To these terms he gladly agreed, and began mowing. And a very
good scythe he found that to be which the woman had given him in
his dream; for it cut well, and never wanted sharpening, though he
worked with it for five days unceasingly. He was well content, too,
with his place, for the old woman was kind enough to him.</p>
<p>One day, entering the forge next to her house, he saw a vast
number of scythe-handles and rakes, and a big heap of blades, and
wondered beyond measure what the old lady could want with all
these. It was the fifth day--the Friday--and when he was asleep
that night, the same elf-woman whom he had seen upon the mountains
came again to him and said:--</p>
<p>"Large as are the meadows you have mown, your employer will
easily be able to rake in all that hay to-morrow, and if she does
so, will, as you know, drive you away without paying you. When
therefore you see yourself worsted, go into the forge, take as many
scythe-handles as you think proper, fit their blades to them, and
carry them out into that part of the land where the hay is yet
uncut. There you must lay them on the ground, and you shall see how
things go."</p>
<p>This said, she disappeared, and in the morning the laborer,
getting up, set to work as usual at his mowing.</p>
<p>At six o'clock the old witch came out, bringing five rakes with
her, and said to the man, "A goodly piece of ground you have mowed,
indeed!"</p>
<p>And so saying, she spread the rakes upon the hay. Then the man
saw, to his astonishment, that though the one she held in her hand
raked in great quantities of hay, the other four raked in no less
each, all of their own accord, and with no hand to wield them.</p>
<p>At noon, seeing that the old woman would soon get the best of
him, he went into the forge and took out several scythe-handles, to
which he fixed their blades, and bringing them out into the field,
laid them down upon the grass which was yet standing. Then all the
scythes set to work of their own accord, and cut down the grass so
quickly that the rakes could not keep pace with them. And so they
went on all the rest of the day, and the old woman was unable to
rake in all the hay which lay in the fields. After dark she told
him to gather up his scythes and take them into the house again,
while she collected her rakes, saying to him:--</p>
<p>"You are wiser than I took you to be, and you know more than
myself; so much the better for you, for you may stay as long with
me as you like."</p>
<p>He spent the whole summer in her employment, and they agreed
very well together, mowing with mighty little trouble a vast amount
of hay. In the autumn she sent him away, well laden with money, to
his own home in the south. The next summer, and more than one
summer following, he spent in her employ, always being paid as his
heart could desire, at the end of the season.</p>
<p>After some years he took a farm of his own in the south country,
and was always looked upon by all his neighbors as an honest man, a
good fisherman, and an able workman in whatever he might put his
hand to. He always cut his own hay, never using any scythe but that
which the elf-woman had given him upon the mountains; nor did any
of his neighbors ever finish their mowing before him.</p>
<p>One summer it chanced that while he was fishing, one of his
neighbors came to his house and asked his wife to lend him her
husband's scythe, as he had lost his own. The farmer's wife looked
for one, but could only find the one upon which her husband set
such store. This, however, a little loth, she lent to the man,
begging him at the same time never to temper it in the fire; for
that, she said, her good man never did. So the neighbor promised,
and taking it with him, bound it to a handle and began to work with
it. But, sweep as he would, and strain as he would (and sweep and
strain he did right lustily), not a single blade of grass fell.
Wroth at this, the man tried to sharpen it, but with no avail. Then
he took it into his forge, intending to temper it, for, thought he,
what harm could that possibly do? but as soon as the flames touched
it, the steel melted like wax, and nothing was left but a little
heap of ashes. Seeing this, he went in haste to the farmer's house,
where he had borrowed it, and told the woman what had happened; she
was at her wits' end with fright and shame when she heard it, for
she knew well enough how her husband set store by this scythe, and
how angry he would be at its loss.</p>
<p>And angry indeed he was, when he came home, and he beat his wife
well for her folly in lending what was not hers to lend. But his
wrath was soon over, and he never again, as he never had before,
laid the stick about his wife's shoulders.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAN-SERVANT_AND_THE_WATER-ELVES"></a>THE
MAN-SERVANT AND THE WATER-ELVES</h2>
<p>In a large house, where all the chief rooms were paneled, there
lived once upon a time a farmer, whose ill-fate it was that every
servant of his that was left alone to guard the house on Christmas
Eve, while the rest of the family went to church, was found dead
when the family returned home. As soon as the report of this was
spread abroad, the farmer had the greatest difficulty in procuring
servants who would consent to watch alone in the house on that
night; until at last, one day a man, a strong fellow, offered him
his services, to sit up alone and guard the house. The farmer told
him what fate awaited him for his rashness; but the man despised
such a fear, and persisted in his determination.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, when the farmer and all his family, except the
new man-servant, were preparing for church, the farmer said to him,
"Come with us to church; I cannot leave you here to die."</p>
<p>But the other replied, "I intend to stay here, for it would be
unwise in you to leave your house unprotected; and besides, the
cattle and sheep must have their food at the proper time."</p>
<p>"Never mind the beasts," answered the farmer. "Do not be so rash
as to remain in the house this night; for whenever we have returned
from church on this night, we have always found every living thing
in the house dead, with all its bones broken."</p>
<p>But the man was not to be persuaded, as he considered all these
fears beneath his notice; so the farmer and the rest of the
servants went away and left him behind, alone in the house.</p>
<p>As soon as he was by himself he began to consider how to guard
against anything that might occur; for a dread had stolen over him,
in spite of his courage, that something strange was about to take
place. At last he thought that the best thing to do was, first of
all to light up the family room; and then to find some place in
which to hide himself. As soon as he had lighted all the candles,
he moved two planks out of the wainscot at the end of the room, and
creeping into the space between it and the wall, restored the
planks to their places, so that he could see plainly into the room
and yet avoid being himself discovered.</p>
<p>He had scarcely finished concealing himself, when two fierce and
strange-looking men entered the room and began looking about.</p>
<p>One of them said, "I smell a human being."</p>
<p>"No," replied the other, "there is no human being here."</p>
<p>Then they took a candle and continued their search, until they
found the man's dog asleep under one of the beds. They took it up,
and having dashed it on the ground till every bone in its body was
broken, hurled it from them. When the man-servant saw this, he
congratulated himself on not having fallen into their hands.</p>
<p>Suddenly the room was filled with people, who were laden with
tables and all kinds of table furniture, silver, cloths, and all,
which they spread out, and having done so, sat down to a rich
supper, which they had also brought with them. They feasted
noisily, and spent the remainder of the night in drinking and
dancing. Two of them were appointed to keep guard, in order to give
the company due warning of the approach either of anybody or of the
day. Three times they went out, always returning with the news that
they saw neither the approach of any human being, nor yet of the
break of day.</p>
<p>But when the man-servant suspected the night to be pretty far
spent, he jumped from his place of concealment into the room, and
clashing the two planks together with as much noise as he could
make, shouted like a madman, "The day! the day! the day!"</p>
<p>On these words the whole company rose scared from their seats,
and rushed headlong out, leaving behind them not only their tables,
and all the silver dishes, but even the very clothes they had taken
off for ease in dancing. In the hurry of flight many were wounded
and trodden under foot, while the rest ran into the darkness, the
man-servant after them, clapping the planks together and shrieking,
"The day! the day! the day!" until they came to a large lake, into
which the whole party plunged headlong and disappeared.</p>
<p>From this the man knew them to be water-elves.</p>
<p>Then he returned home, gathered the corpses of the elves who had
been killed in the flight, killed the wounded ones, and, making a
great heap of them all, burned them. When he had finished this
task, he cleaned up the house and took possession of all the
treasures the elves had left behind them.</p>
<p>On the farmer's return, his servant told him all that had
occurred, and showed him the spoils. The farmer praised him for a
brave fellow, and congratulated him on having escaped with his
life. The man gave him half the treasures of the elves, and ever
afterward prospered exceedingly.</p>
<p>This was the last visit the water-elves ever paid to <i>that</i>
house.</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="THE_CROSSWAYS"></a>THE CROSSWAYS</h2>
<p>It is supposed that among the hills there are certain
cross-roads, from the centre of which you can see four churches,
one at the end of each road.</p>
<p>If you sit at the crossing of these roads on Christmas Eve (or
as others say, on New Year's Eve), elves come from every direction
and cluster round you, and ask you, with all sorts of blandishments
and fair promises, to go with them; but you must continue silent.
Then they bring to you rarities and delicacies of every
description, gold, silver, and precious stones, meats and wines, of
which they beg you to accept; but you must neither move a limb nor
accept a single thing they offer you. If you get so far as this
without speaking, elf-women come to you in the likeness of your
mother, your sister, or any other relation, and beg you to come
with them, using every art and entreaty; but beware you neither
move nor speak. And if you can continue to keep silent and
motionless all the night, until you see the first streak of dawn,
then start up and cry aloud, "Praise be to God! His daylight
filleth the heavens!"</p>
<p>As soon as you have said this, the elves will leave you, and
with you all the wealth they have used to entice you, which will
now be yours.</p>
<p>But should you either answer, or accept of their offers, you
will from that moment become mad.</p>
<p>On the night of one Christmas Eve, a man named Fusi was out on
the cross-roads, and managed to resist all the entreaties and
proffers of the elves, until one of them offered him a large lump
of mutton-suet, and begged him to take a bite of it. Fusi, who had
up to this time gallantly resisted all such offers as gold and
silver and diamonds and such filthy lucre, could hold out no
longer, and crying, "Seldom have I refused a bite of mutton-suet,"
he went mad.</p>

<h2><a name="ERNST_MORITZ_ARNDT"></a>ERNST MORITZ ARNDT</h2>
<h3>(1769-1860)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-s.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>prung from the sturdy peasant stock of the north, to which
patriotism is a chief virtue, Ernst Moritz Arndt first saw the
light at Schoritz, Island of R&uuml;gen (then a dependency of
Sweden), December 29th, 1769. His father, once a serf, had achieved
a humble independence, and he destined his clever son for the
ministry, the one vocation open to him which meant honor and
advancement. The young man studied theology at Greifswald and Jena,
but later turned his attention exclusively to history and
literature. His early life is delightfully described in his
'Stories and Recollections of Childhood.' His youth was molded by
the influence of Goethe, Klopstock, B&uuml;rger, and Voss. After
completing his university studies he traveled extensively in
Austria, Hungary, and Northern Italy. His account of these
journeys, published in 1802, shows his keen observation of men and
affairs.</p>
<p class="rgt"><img src="images/image-355.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>ERNST ARNDT</b></p>
<p>He began his long service to his country by his 'History of
Serfdom in Pomerania and Sweden,' which contributed largely to the
general abolition of the ancient abuse. He became professor of
history in the University of Greifswald in 1806, and about that
time began to publish the first series of the 'Spirit of the
Times.' These were stirring appeals to rouse the Germans against
the oppressions of Napoleon. In consequence he was obliged to flee
to Sweden. After three years he returned under an assumed name, and
again took up his work at Greifswald. In 1812, after the occupation
of Pomerania by the French, his fierce denunciations again forced
him to flee, this time to Russia, the only refuge open to him.
There he joined Baron von Stein, who eagerly made use of him in his
schemes for the liberation of Germany. At this time his finest
poems were written: those kindling war songs that appealed so
strongly to German patriotism, when "songs were sermons and sermons
were songs." The most famous of these, 'What is the German's
Fatherland?' 'The Song of the Field-marshal,' and 'The God Who Made
Earth's Iron Hoard,' still live as national lyrics.</p>
<p>Arndt was also constantly occupied in writing pamphlets of the
most stirring nature, as their titles show:--'The Rhine, Germany's
River, but Never Germany's Boundary'; 'The Soldier's Catechism';
and 'The Militia and the General Levy.' After the disasters of the
French in Russia, he returned to Germany, unceasingly devoted to
his task of rousing the people. Though by birth a Swede, he had
become at heart a Prussian, seeing in Prussia alone the possibility
of German unity.</p>
<p>In 1817 he married Schleiermacher's sister, and the following
year was appointed professor of history in the newly established
University of Bonn. Shortly afterward suspended, on account of his
liberal views, he was forced to spend twenty years in retirement.
His leisure gave opportunity for literary work, however, and he
availed himself of it by producing several historical treatises and
his interesting 'Reminiscences of My Public Life.' One of the first
acts of Frederick William IV., after his accession, was to restore
Arndt to his professorship at Bonn. He took a lively interest in
the events of 1848, and belonged to the deputation that offered the
imperial crown to the King of Prussia. He continued in the hope and
the advocacy of German unity, though he did not live to see it
realized. The ninetieth birthday of "Father Arndt," as he was
fondly called by his countrymen, was celebrated with general
rejoicing throughout Germany. He died shortly afterward, on January
29th, 1860.</p>
<p>Arndt's importance as a poet is due to the stirring scenes of
his earlier life and the political needs of Germany. He was no
genius. He was not even a deep scholar. His only great work is his
war-songs and patriotic ballads. Germany honors his manly character
and patriotic zeal in that stormy period of Liberation which led
through many apparent defeats to the united Empire of to-day.</p>
<p>The best German biographies are that of Schenkel (1869), W. Baur
(1882), and Langenberg (1869); the latter in 1878 edited 'Arndt's
Letters to a Friend.' J.R. Seeley's 'Life and Adventures of E.M.
Arndt' (1879) is founded on the latter's 'Reminiscences of My
Public Life.</p>

<h2><a name="EDWIN_ARNOLD"></a>EDWIN ARNOLD</h2>
<h3>(1832-)</h3>
<br>

<p>he favorite and now venerable English poet, Edwin Arnold, showed
his skill in smooth and lucid verse early in life. In 1852, when
twenty years of age, he won the Newdigate Prize at Oxford for a
poem, 'The Feast of Belshazzar.' Two years later, after graduation
with honors, he was named second master of Edward the Sixth's
School at Birmingham; and, a few years subsequent, principal of the
Government Sanskrit College at Poona, in India. In 1856 he
published 'Griselda, a Tragedy'; and after his return to London in
1861, translations from the Greek of Herodotus and the Sanskrit of
the Indian classic 'Hitopade&ccedil;a,' the latter under the name
of 'The Book of Good Counsels.' There followed from his pen
'Education in India'; 'A History of the Administration in India
under the Late Marquis of Dalhousie' (1862-64); and 'The Poets of
Greece,' a collection of fine passages (1869). In addition to his
other labors he has been one of the editors-in-chief of the London
Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>Saturated with the Orient, familiar with every aspect of its
civilization, moral and religious life, history and feeling, Sir
Edwin's literary work has attested his knowledge in a large number
of smaller poetical productions, and a group of religious epics of
long and impressive extent. Chiefest among them ranks that on the
life and teachings of Buddha, 'The Light of Asia; or, The Great
Renunciation' (1879). It has passed through more than eighty
editions in this country, and almost as many in England. In
recognition of this work Mr. Arnold was decorated by the King of
Siam with the Order of the White Elephant. Two years after its
appearance he published 'Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata,' 'Indian Idylls,'
and in 1883, 'Pearls of the Faith; or, Islam's Rosary Being the
Ninety-nine Beautiful Names of Allah, with Comments in Verse from
Various Oriental Sources.' In 1886 the Sultan conferred on him the
Imperial Order of Osmanli, and in 1888 he was created Knight
Commander of the Indian Empire by Queen Victoria. 'Sa'di in the
Garden; or, The Book of Love' (1888), a poem turning on a part of
the 'B&ocirc;st&acirc;ni' of the Persian poet Sa'di, brought Sir
Edwin the Order of the Lion and Sun from the Shah of Persia. In
1888 he published also 'Poems National and Non-Oriental.' Since
then he has written 'The Light of the World'; 'Potiphar's Wife, and
Other Poems' (1892); 'The Iliad and Odyssey of Asia,' and in prose,
'India Revisited' (1891); 'Seas and Lands'; 'Japonica,' which
treats of life and things Japanese; and 'Adzuma, the Japanese Wife:
a Play in Four Acts' (1893). During his travels in Japan the
Emperor decorated him with the Order of the Rising Sun. In 1893 Sir
Edwin was chosen President of the Birmingham and Midland Institute.
His latest volume, 'The Tenth Muse and Other Poems,' appeared in
1895.</p>
<p>'The Light of Asia,' the most successful of his works, attracted
instant attention on its appearance, as a novelty of rich Indian
local color. In substance it is a graceful and dramatic paraphrase
of the mass of more or less legendary tales of the life and
spiritual career of the Buddha, Prince Gautama, and a summary of
the principles of the great religious system originating with him.
It is lavishly embellished with Indian allusions, and expresses
incidentally the very spirit of the East. In numerous cantos,
proceeding from episode to episode of its mystical hero's career,
its effect is that of a loftily ethical, picturesque, and
fascinating biography, in highly polished verse. The metre selected
is a graceful and dignified one, especially associated with
'Paradise Lost' and other of the foremost classics of English
verse. Sir Edwin says of the poem in his preface, "I have sought,
by the medium of an imaginary Buddhist votary, to depict the life
and character and indicate the philosophy of that noble hero and
reformer, Prince Gautama of India, the founder of Buddhism;" and
the poet has admirably, if most flatteringly, succeeded. The poem
has been printed in innumerable cheap editions as well as those
<i>de luxe</i>; and while it has been criticized as too complaisant
a study of even primitive Buddhism, it is beyond doubt a lyrical
tract of eminent utility as well as seductive charm.</p>
<br>
<p class="heading"><a name="THE_YOUTH_OF_BUDDHA"></a> <b>THE YOUTH
OF BUDDHA</b></p>
<blockquote>From 'The Light of Asia'</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>This reverence<br>
Lord Buddha kept to all his schoolmasters,<br>
Albeit beyond their learning taught; in speech<br>
Right gentle, yet so wise; princely of mien,<br>
Yet softly mannered; modest, deferent,<br>
And tender-hearted, though of fearless blood:<br>
No bolder horseman in the youthful band<br>
E'er rode in gay chase of the shy gazelles;<br>
No keener driver of the chariot<br>
In mimic contest scoured the palace courts:<br>
Yet in mid-play the boy would oft-times pause,<br>
Letting the deer pass free; would oft-times yield<br>
His half-won race because the laboring steeds<br>
Fetched painful breath; or if his princely mates<br>
Saddened to lose, or if some wistful dream<br>
Swept o'er his thoughts. And ever with the years<br>
Waxed this compassionateness of our Lord,<br>
Even as a great tree grows from two soft leaves<br>
To spread its shade afar; but hardly yet<br>
Knew the young child of sorrow, pain, or tears,<br>
Save as strange names for things not felt by kings,<br>
Nor ever to be felt. But it befell<br>
In the royal garden on a day of spring,<br>
A flock of wild swans passed, voyaging north<br>
To their nest-places on Him&aacute;la's breast.<br>
Calling in love-notes down their snowy line<br>
The bright birds flew, by fond love piloted;<br>
And Devadatta, cousin of the Prince,<br>
Pointed his bow, and loosed a willful shaft<br>
Which found the wide wing of the foremost swan<br>
Broad-spread to glide upon the free blue road,<br>
So that it fell, the bitter arrow fixed,<br>
Bright scarlet blood-gouts staining the pure plumes.<br>
Which seeing, Prince Sidd&acirc;rtha took the bird<br>
Tenderly up, rested it in his lap,--<br>
Sitting with knees crossed, as Lord Buddha sits,--<br>
And, soothing with a touch the wild thing's fright,<br>
Composed its ruffled vans, calmed its quick heart,<br>
Caressed it into peace with light kind palms<br>
As soft as plantain leaves an hour unrolled;<br>
And while the left hand held, the right hand drew<br>
The cruel steel forth from the wound, and laid<br>
Cool leaves and healing honey on the smart.<br>
Yet all so little knew the boy of pain,<br>
That curiously into his wrist he pressed<br>
The arrow's barb, and winced to feel it sting,<br>
And turned with tears to soothe his bird again.<br>
Then some one came who said, "My Prince hath shot<br>
A swan, which fell among the roses here;<br>
He bids me pray you send it. Will you send?"<br>
"Nay," quoth Sidd&acirc;rtha: "If the bird were dead,<br>
To send it to the slayer might be well,<br>
But the swan lives; my cousin hath but killed<br>
The godlike speed which throbbed in this white wing."<br>
And Devadatta answered, "The wild thing,<br>
Living or dead, is his who fetched it down;<br>
'Twas no man's in the clouds, but fallen 'tis mine.<br>
Give me my prize, fair cousin." Then our Lord<br>
Laid the swan's neck beside his own smooth cheek<br>
And gravely spake:--"Say no! the bird is mine,<br>
The first of myriad things which shall be mine<br>
By right of mercy and love's lordliness.<br>
For now I know, by what within me stirs.<br>
That I shall teach compassion unto men<br>
And be a speechless world's interpreter,<br>
Abating this accursed flood of woe.<br>
Not man's alone; but if the Prince disputes,<br>
Let him submit this matter to the wise<br>
And we will wait their word." So was it done;<br>
In full divan the business had debate,<br>
And many thought this thing and many that,<br>
Till there arose an unknown priest who said,<br>
"If life be aught, the savior of a life<br>
Owns more the living thing than he can own<br>
Who sought to slay; the slayer spoils and wastes,<br>
The cherisher sustains: give him the bird."<br>
Which judgment all found just; but when the King<br>
Sought out the sage for honor, he was gone;<br>
And some one saw a hooded snake glide forth.<br>
The gods come oft-times thus! So our Lord Buddha<br>
Began his works of mercy.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet not more<br>
Knew he as yet of grief than that one bird's,<br>
Which, being healed, went joyous to its kind.<br>
But on another day the King said, "Come,<br>
Sweet son! and see the pleasaunce of the spring,<br>
And how the fruitful earth is wooed to yield<br>
Its riches to the reaper; how my realm--<br>
Which shall be thine when the pile flames for me--<br>
Feeds all its mouths and keeps the King's chest filled.<br>
Fair is the season with new leaves, bright blooms,<br>
Green grass, and cries of plow-time." So they rode<br>
Into a land of wells and gardens, where,<br>
All up and down the rich red loam, the steers<br>
Strained their strong shoulders in the creaking yoke,<br>
Dragging the plows; the fat soil rose and rolled<br>
In smooth dark waves back from the plow; who drove<br>
Planted both feet upon the leaping share<br>
To make the furrow deep; among the palms<br>
The tinkle of the rippling water rang,<br>
And where it ran the glad earth 'broidered it<br>
With balsams and the spears of lemon-grass.<br>
Elsewhere were sowers who went forth to sow;<br>
And all the jungle laughed with nesting-songs,<br>
And all the thickets rustled with small life<br>
Of lizard, bee, beetle, and creeping things,<br>
Pleased at the springtime. In the mango-sprays<br>
The sunbirds flashed; alone at his green forge<br>
Toiled the loud coppersmith; bee-eaters hawked,<br>
Chasing the purple butterflies; beneath,<br>
Striped squirrels raced, the mynas perked and picked,<br>
The nine brown sisters chattered in the thorn,<br>
The pied fish-tiger hung above the pool,<br>
The egrets stalked among the buffaloes,<br>
The kites sailed circles in the golden air;<br>
About the painted temple peacocks flew,<br>
The blue doves cooed from every well, far off<br>
The village drums beat for some marriage feast;<br>
All things spoke peace and plenty, and the Prince<br>
Saw and rejoiced. But, looking deep, he saw<br>
The thorns which grow upon this rose of life:<br>
How the swart peasant sweated for his wage,<br>
Toiling for leave to live; and how he urged<br>
The great-eyed oxen through the flaming hours,<br>
Goading their velvet flanks: then marked he, too,<br>
How lizard fed on ant, and snake on him,<br>
And kite on both; and how the fish-hawk robbed<br>
The fish-tiger of that which it had seized;<br>
The shrike chasing the bulbul, which did chase<br>
The jeweled butterflies; till everywhere<br>
Each slew a slayer and in turn was slain,<br>
Life living upon death. So the fair show<br>
Veiled one vast, savage, grim conspiracy<br>
Of mutual murder, from the worm to man,<br>
Who himself kills his fellow; seeing which--<br>
The hungry plowman and his laboring kine,<br>
Their dewlaps blistered with the bitter yoke,<br>
The rage to live which makes all living strife--<br>
The Prince Sidd&acirc;rtha sighed. "Is this," he said,<br>
"That happy earth they brought me forth to see?<br>
How salt with sweat the peasant's bread! how hard<br>
The oxen's service! in the brake how fierce<br>
The war of weak and strong! i' th' air what plots!<br>
No refuge e'en in water. Go aside<br>
A space, and let me muse on what ye show."<br>
So saying, the good Lord Buddha seated him<br>
Under a jambu-tree, with ankles crossed,<br>
As holy statues sit, and first began<br>
To meditate this deep disease of life,<br>
What its far source and whence its remedy.<br>
So vast a pity filled him, such wide love<br>
For living things, such passion to heal pain,<br>
That by their stress his princely spirit passed<br>
To ecstasy, and, purged from mortal taint<br>
Of sense and self, the boy attained thereat<br>
Dhy&acirc;na, first step of "the Path."</blockquote>

<b>THE PURE SACRIFICE OF BUDDHA</b></p>
<blockquote>From 'The Light of Asia'</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>Onward he passed,<br>
Exceeding sorrowful, seeing how men<br>
Fear so to die they are afraid to fear,<br>
Lust so to live they dare not love their life,<br>
But plague it with fierce penances, belike<br>
To please the gods who grudge pleasure to man;<br>
Belike to balk hell by self-kindled hells;<br>
Belike in holy madness, hoping soul<br>
May break the better through their wasted flesh.<br>
"O flowerets of the field!" Sidd&acirc;rtha said,<br>
"Who turn your tender faces to the sun,--<br>
Glad of the light, and grateful with sweet breath<br>
Of fragrance and these robes of reverence donned,<br>
Silver and gold and purple,--none of ye<br>
Miss perfect living, none of ye despoil<br>
Your happy beauty. O ye palms! which rise<br>
Eager to pierce the sky and drink the wind<br>
Blown from Malaya and the cool blue seas;<br>
What secret know ye that ye grow content,<br>
From time of tender shoot to time of fruit,<br>
Murmuring such sun-songs from your feathered crowns?<br>
Ye too, who dwell so merry in the trees,--<br>
Quick-darting parrots, bee-birds, bulbuls, doves,--<br>
None of ye hate your life, none of ye deem<br>
To strain to better by foregoing needs!<br>
But man, who slays ye--being lord--is wise,<br>
And wisdom, nursed on blood, cometh thus forth<br>
In self-tormentings!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
While the Master spake<br>
Blew down the mount the dust of pattering feet,<br>
White goats and black sheep winding slow their way<br>
With many a lingering nibble at the tufts,<br>
And wanderings from the path, where water gleamed<br>
Or wild figs hung. But always as they strayed<br>
The herdsman cried, or slung his sling, and kept<br>
The silly crowd still moving to the plain.<br>
A ewe with couplets in the flock there was:<br>
Some hurt had lamed one lamb, which toiled behind<br>
Bleeding, while in the front its fellow skipped,<br>
And the vexed dam hither and thither ran,<br>
Fearful to lose this little one or that;<br>
Which when our Lord did mark, full tenderly<br>
He took the limping lamb upon his neck,<br>
Saying, "Poor wooly mother, be at peace!<br>
Whither thou goest I will bear thy care;<br>
'Twere all as good to ease one beast of grief<br>
As sit and watch the sorrows of the world<br>
In yonder caverns with the priests who pray."<br>
"But," spake he of the herdsmen, "wherefore, friends!<br>
Drive ye the flocks adown under high noon,<br>
Since 'tis at evening that men fold their sheep?"<br>
<br>
And answer gave the peasants:--"We are sent<br>
To fetch a sacrifice of goats fivescore,<br>
And fivescore sheep, the which our Lord the King<br>
Slayeth this night in worship of his gods."<br>
<br>
Then said the Master, "I will also go!"<br>
So paced he patiently, bearing the lamb<br>
Beside the herdsmen in the dust and sun,<br>
The wistful ewe low bleating at his feet.<br>
Whom, when they came unto the river-side,<br>
A woman--dove-eyed, young, with tearful face<br>
And lifted hands--saluted, bending low:--<br>
"Lord! thou art he," she said, "who yesterday<br>
Had pity on me in the fig grove here,<br>
Where I live lone and reared my child; but he,<br>
Straying amid the blossoms, found a snake,<br>
Which twined about his wrist, while he did laugh<br>
And teased the quick forked tongue and opened mouth<br>
Of that cold playmate. But alas! ere long<br>
He turned so pale and still, I could not think<br>
Why he should cease to play, and let my breast<br>
Fall from his lips. And one said, 'He is sick<br>
Of poison;' and another, 'He will die.'<br>
But I, who could not lose my precious boy,<br>
Prayed of them physic, which might bring the light<br>
Back to his eyes; it was so very small,<br>
That kiss-mark of the serpent, and I think<br>
It could not hate him, gracious as he was,<br>
Nor hurt him in his sport. And some one said,<br>
'There is a holy man upon the hill--<br>
Lo! now he passeth in the yellow robe;<br>
Ask of the Rishi if there be a cure<br>
For that which ails thy son.' Whereon I came<br>
Trembling to thee, whose brow is like a god's,<br>
And wept and drew the face-cloth from my babe,<br>
Praying thee tell what simples might be good.<br>
And thou, great sir! didst spurn me not, but gaze<br>
With gentle eyes and touch with patient hand;<br>
Then draw the face-cloth back, saying to me,<br>
'Yea! little sister, there is that might heal<br>
Thee first, and him, if thou couldst fetch the thing;<br>
For they who seek physicians bring to them<br>
What is ordained. Therefore, I pray thee, find<br>
Black mustard-seed, a tola; only mark<br>
Thou take it not from any hand or house<br>
Where father, mother, child, or slave hath died;<br>
It shall be well if thou canst find such seed.'<br>
Thus didst thou speak, my lord!"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Master smiled<br>
Exceeding tenderly. "Yea! I spake thus,<br>
Dear Kisag&ocirc;tami! But didst thou find<br>
The seed?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"I went, Lord, clasping to my breast<br>
The babe, grown colder, asking at each hut,--<br>
Here in the jungle and toward the town,--<br>
'I pray you, give me mustard, of your grace,<br>
A tola--black' and each who had it gave,<br>
For all the poor are piteous to the poor:<br>
But when I asked, 'In my friend's household here<br>
Hath any peradventure ever died--<br>
Husband or wife, or child, or slave?' they said:--<br>
'O sister! what is this you ask? the dead<br>
Are very many and the living few!'<br>
So, with sad thanks, I gave the mustard back,<br>
And prayed of others, but the others said,<br>
'Here is the seed, but we have lost our slave!'<br>
'Here is the seed, but our good man is dead!'<br>
'Here is some seed, but he that sowed it died!<br>
Between the rain-time and the harvesting!'<br>
Ah, sir! I could not find a single house<br>
Where there was mustard-seed and none had died!<br>
Therefore I left my child--who would not suck<br>
Nor smile--beneath the wild vines by the stream,<br>
To seek thy face and kiss thy feet, and pray<br>
Where I might find this seed and find no death,<br>
If now, indeed, my baby be not dead,<br>
As I do fear, and as they said to me."<br>
<br>
"My sister! thou hast found," the Master said,<br>
"Searching for what none finds, that bitter balm<br>
I had to give thee. He thou lovedst slept<br>
Dead on thy bosom yesterday; to-day<br>
Thou know'st the whole wide world weeps with thy woe;<br>
The grief which all hearts share grows less for one.<br>
Lo! I would pour my blood if it could stay<br>
Thy tears, and win the secret of that curse<br>
Which makes sweet love our anguish, and which drives<br>
O'er flowers and pastures to the sacrifice--<br>
As these dumb beasts are driven--men their lords.<br>
I seek that secret: bury thou thy child!"<br>
<br>
So entered they the city side by side,<br>
The herdsmen and the Prince, what time the sun<br>
Gilded slow Sona's distant stream, and threw<br>
Long shadows down the street and through the gate<br>
Where the King's men kept watch. But when these saw<br>
Our Lord bearing the lamb, the guards stood back,<br>
The market-people drew their wains aside,<br>
In the bazaar buyers and sellers stayed<br>
The war of tongues to gaze on that mild face;<br>
The smith, with lifted hammer in his hand,<br>
Forgot to strike; the weaver left his web,<br>
The scribe his scroll, the money-changer lost<br>
His count of cowries; from the unwatched rice<br>
Shiva's white bull fed free; the wasted milk<br>
Ran o'er the lota while the milkers watched<br>
The passage of our Lord moving so meek,<br>
With yet so beautiful a majesty.<br>
But most the women gathering in the doors<br>
Asked, "Who is this that brings the sacrifice<br>
So graceful and peace-giving as he goes?<br>
What is his caste? whence hath he eyes so sweet?<br>
Can he be S&acirc;kra or the Devaraj?"<br>
And others said, "It is the holy man<br>
Who dwelleth with the Rishis on the hill."<br>
But the Lord paced, in meditation lost,<br>
Thinking, "Alas! for all my sheep which have<br>
No shepherd; wandering in the night with none<br>
To guide them; bleating blindly toward the knife<br>
Of Death, as these dumb beasts which are their kin."<br>
<br>
Then some one told the King, "There cometh here<br>
A holy hermit, bringing down the flock<br>
Which thou didst bid to crown the sacrifice."<br>
<br>
The King stood in his hall of offering;<br>
On either hand the white-robed Brahmans ranged<br>
Muttered their mantras, feeding still the fire<br>
Which roared upon the midmost altar. There<br>
From scented woods flickered bright tongues of flame,<br>
Hissing and curling as they licked the gifts<br>
Of ghee and spices and the Soma juice,<br>
The joy of Indra. Round about the pile<br>
A slow, thick, scarlet streamlet smoked and ran,<br>
Sucked by the sand, but ever rolling down,<br>
The blood of bleating victims. One such lay,<br>
A spotted goat, long-horned, its head bound back<br>
With munja grass; at its stretched throat the knife<br>
Pressed by a priest, who murmured, "This, dread gods.<br>
Of many yajnas cometh as the crown<br>
From Bimbas&acirc;ra: take ye joy to see<br>
The spirted blood, and pleasure in the scent<br>
Of rich flesh roasting 'mid the fragrant flames;<br>
Let the King's sins be laid upon this goat,<br>
And let the fire consume them burning it,<br>
For now I strike."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But Buddha softly said,<br>
"Let him not strike, great King!" and therewith loosed<br>
The victim's bonds, none staying him, so great<br>
His presence was. Then, craving leave, he spake<br>
Of life, which all can take, but none can give,<br>
Life, which all creatures love and strive to keep,<br>
Wonderful, dear and pleasant unto each,<br>
Even to the meanest; yea, a boon to all<br>
Where pity is, for pity makes the world<br>
Soft to the weak and noble for the strong.<br>
Unto the dumb lips of his flock he lent<br>
Sad, pleading words, showing how man, who prays<br>
For mercy to the gods, is merciless,<br>
Being as god to those; albeit all life<br>
Is linked and kin, and what we slay have given<br>
Meek tribute of the milk and wool, and set<br>
Fast trust upon the hands which murder them.<br>
Also he spake of what the holy books<br>
Do surely teach, how that at death some sink<br>
To bird and beast, and these rise up to man<br>
In wanderings of the spark which grows purged flame.<br>
So were the sacrifice new sin, if so<br>
The fated passage of a soul be stayed.<br>
Nor, spake he, shall one wash his spirit clean<br>
By blood; nor gladden gods, being good, with blood;<br>
Nor bribe them, being evil; nay, nor lay<br>
Upon the brow of innocent bound beasts<br>
One hair's weight of that answer all must give<br>
For all things done amiss or wrongfully,<br>
Alone, each for himself, reckoning with that<br>
The fixed arithmetic of the universe,<br>
Which meteth good for good and ill for ill,<br>
Measure for measure, unto deeds, words, thoughts;<br>
Watchful, aware, implacable, unmoved;<br>
Making all futures fruits of all the pasts.<br>
Thus spake he, breathing words so piteous<br>
With such high lordliness of ruth and right,<br>
The priests drew back their garments o'er the hands<br>
Crimsoned with slaughter, and the King came near,<br>
Standing with clasped palms reverencing Buddha;<br>
While still our Lord went on, teaching how fair<br>
This earth were if all living things be linked<br>
In friendliness of common use of foods,<br>
Bloodless and pure; the golden grain, bright fruits,<br>
Sweet herbs which grow for all, the waters wan,<br>
Sufficient drinks and meats. Which, when these heard,<br>
The might of gentleness so conquered them,<br>
The priests themselves scattered their altar-flames<br>
And flung away the steel of sacrifice;<br>
And through the land next day passed a decree<br>
Proclaimed by criers, and in this wise graved<br>
On rock and column:--"Thus the King's will is:<br>
There hath been slaughter for the sacrifice<br>
And slaying for the meat, but henceforth none<br>
Shall spill the blood of life nor taste of flesh,<br>
Seeing that knowledge grows, and life is one,<br>
And mercy cometh to the merciful."<br>
So ran the edict, and from those days forth<br>
Sweet peace hath spread between all living kind,<br>

<b>THE FAITHFULNESS OF YUDHISTHIRA</b></p>
<blockquote>From 'The Great Journey,' in the
Mah&acirc;bh&acirc;rata</blockquote>
<br>
<blockquote>Thenceforth alone the long-armed monarch strode,<br>
Not looking back,--nay, not for Bhima's sake,--But<br>
walking with his face set for the mount;<br>
And the hound followed him,--only the hound.<br>
<br>
After the deathly sands, the Mount; and lo!<br>
S&acirc;kra shone forth, the God, filling the earth<br>
And heavens with thunder of his chariot-wheels.<br>
"Ascend," he said, "with me, Pritha's great son!"<br>
But Yudhisthira answered, sore at heart<br>
For those his kinsfolk, fallen on the way:<br>
"O Thousand-eyed, O Lord of all the gods,<br>
Give that my brothers come with me, who fell!<br>
Not without them is Swarga sweet to me.<br>
She, too, the dear and kind and queenly,--she<br>
Whose perfect virtue Paradise must crown,--Grant<br>
her to come with us! Dost thou grant this?"<br>
<br>
The God replied:--"In heaven thou shalt see<br>
Thy kinsman and the Queen--these will attain--And<br>
Krishna. Grieve no longer for thy dead,<br>
Thou chief of men! their mortal covering stripped,<br>
These have their places; but to thee the gods<br>
Allot an unknown grace; Thou shalt go up,<br>
Living and in thy form, to the immortal homes."<br>
<br>
But the King answered:--"O thou Wisest One,<br>
Who know'st what was, and is, and is to be,<br>
Still one more grace! This hound hath ate with me,<br>
Followed me, loved me: must I leave him now?"<br>
<br>
"Monarch," spake Indra, "thou art now as we,--<br>
Deathless, divine; thou art become a god;<br>
Glory and power and gifts celestial,<br>
And all the joys of heaven are thine for aye;<br>
What hath a beast with these? Leave here thy hound."<br>
<br>
Yet Yudhisthira answered:--"O Most High,<br>
O, Thousand-eyed and wisest! can it be<br>
That one exalted should seem pitiless?<br>
Nay, let me lose such glory; for its sake<br>
I cannot leave one living thing I loved."<br>
<br>
Then sternly Indra spake:--"He is unclean,<br>
And into Swarga such shall enter not.<br>
The Krodhavasha's wrath destroys the fruits<br>
Of sacrifice, if dogs defile the fire.<br>
Bethink thee, Dharmaraj; quit now this beast!<br>
That which is seemly is not hard of heart."<br>
<br>
Still he replied:--"Tis written that to spurn<br>
A suppliant equals in offense to slay<br>
A twice-born; wherefore, not for Swarga's bliss<br>
Quit I, Mahendra, this poor clinging dog,--<br>
So without any hope or friend save me,<br>
So wistful, fawning for my faithfulness;<br>
So agonized to die, unless I help<br>
Who among men was called steadfast and just."<br>
<br>
Quoth Indra:--"Nay, the altar-flame is foul<br>
Where a dog passeth; angry angels sweep<br>
The ascending smoke aside, and all the fruits<br>
Of offering, and the merit of the prayer<br>
Of him whom a hound toucheth. Leave it here!<br>
He that will enter heaven must enter pure.<br>
Why didst thou quit thy brethren on the way,<br>
And Krishna, and the dear-loved Draupad&iacute;,<br>
Attaining, firm and glorious, to this Mount<br>
Through perfect deeds, to linger for a brute?<br>
Hath Yudhisthira vanquished self, to melt<br>
With one poor passion at the door of bliss?<br>
Stay'st thou for this, who didst not stay for them,--<br>
Draupad&iacute;, Bhima?"<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
But the King yet spake:--<br>
"'Tis known that none can hurt or help the dead.<br>
They, the delightful ones, who sank and died,<br>
Following my footsteps, could not live again<br>
Though I had turned,--therefore I did not turn;<br>
But could help profit, I had stayed to help.<br>
There be four sins, O S&acirc;kra, grievous sins:<br>
The first is making suppliants despair,<br>
The second is to slay a nursing wife,<br>
The third is spoiling Brahmans' goods by force,<br>
The fourth is injuring an ancient friend.<br>
These four I deem not direr than the crime,<br>
If one, in coming forth from woe to weal,<br>
Abandon any meanest comrade then."<br>
<br>
Straight as he spake, brightly great Indra smiled;<br>
Vanished the hound, and in its stead stood there<br>
The Lord of Death and Justice, Dharma's self!<br>
Sweet were the words which fell from those dread lips,<br>
Precious the lovely praise:--"O thou true King,<br>
Thou that dost bring to harvest the good seed<br>
Of Pandu's righteousness; thou that hast ruth<br>
As he before, on all which lives!--O son!<br>
I tried thee in the Dwaita wood, what time<br>
They smote thy brothers, bringing water; then<br>
Thou prayedst for Nakula's life--tender and just--<br>
Nor Bhima's nor Arjuna's, true to both,<br>
To Madri as to Kunti, to both queens.<br>
Hear thou my word! Because thou didst not mount<br>
This car divine, lest the poor hound be shent<br>
Who looked to thee, lo! there is none in heaven<br>
Shall sit above thee, King!--Bh&acirc;rata's son!<br>
Enter thou now to the eternal joys,<br>
Living and in thy form. Justice and Love<br>
Welcome thee, Monarch! thou shalt throne with us."</blockquote>

<br>
<blockquote>"She is dead!" they said to him: "come away;<br>
Kiss her and leave her,--thy love is clay!"<br>
<br>
They smoothed her tresses of dark-brown hair;<br>
On her forehead of stone they laid it fair;<br>
<br>
Over her eyes that gazed too much<br>
They drew the lids with a gentle touch;<br>
<br>
With a tender touch they closed up well<br>
The sweet thin lips that had secrets to tell;<br>
<br>
About her brows and beautiful face<br>
They tied her veil and her marriage lace,<br>
<br>
And drew on her white feet her white-silk shoes,--<br>
Which were the whitest no eye could choose,--<br>
<br>
And over her bosom they crossed her hands,<br>
"Come away!" they said, "God understands."<br>
<br>
And there was silence, and nothing there<br>
But silence, and scents of eglantere,<br>
<br>
And jasmine, and roses and rosemary;<br>
And they said, "As a lady should lie, lies she."<br>
<br>
And they held their breath till they left the room,<br>
With a shudder, to glance at its stillness and gloom.<br>
<br>
But he who loved her too well to dread<br>
The sweet, the stately, the beautiful dead,<br>
<br>
He lit his lamp, and took the key<br>
And turned it--alone again, he and she.<br>
<br>
He and she; but she would not speak,<br>
Though he kissed, in the old place, the quiet cheek.<br>
<br>
He and she; yet she would not smile,<br>
Though he called her the name she loved erewhile.<br>
<br>
He and she; still she did not move<br>
To any passionate whisper of love.<br>
<br>
Then he said, "Cold lips and breasts without breath,<br>
Is there no voice, no language of death,<br>
<br>
"Dumb to the ear and still to the sense,<br>
But to heart and to soul distinct, intense?<br>
<br>
"See, now; I will listen with soul, not ear:<br>
What was the secret of dying, dear?<br>
<br>
"Was it the infinite wonder of all<br>
That you ever could let life's flower fall?<br>
<br>
"Or was it a greater marvel to feel<br>
The perfect calm o'er the agony steal?<br>
<br>
"Was the miracle greater to find how deep<br>
Beyond all dreams sank downward that sleep?<br>
<br>
"Did life roll back its record dear,<br>
And show, as they say it does, past things clear?<br>
<br>
"And was it the innermost heart of the bliss<br>
To find out so, what a wisdom love is?<br>
<br>
"O perfect dead! O dead most dear!<br>
I hold the breath of my soul to hear.<br>
<br>
"I listen as deep as to horrible hell,<br>
As high as to heaven, and you do not tell.<br>
<br>
"There must be pleasure in dying, sweet,<br>
To make you so placid from head to feet!<br>
<br>
"I would tell you, darling, if I were dead,<br>
And 'twere your hot tears upon my brow shed,--<br>
<br>
"I would say, though the Angel of Death had laid<br>
His sword on my lips to keep it unsaid,--<br>
<br>
"You should not ask vainly, with streaming eyes,<br>
Which of all deaths was the chiefest surprise.<br>
<br>
"The very strangest and suddenest thing<br>
Of all the surprises that dying must bring."<br>
<br>
Ah, foolish world! O most kind dead!<br>
Though he told me, who will believe it was said?<br>
<br>
Who will believe that he heard her say,<br>
With the sweet, soft voice, in the dear old way,<br>
<br>
"The utmost wonder is this,--I hear<br>
And see you, and love you, and kiss you, dear;<br>
<br>
"And am your angel, who was your bride,<br>
And know that though dead, I have never died."</blockquote>

Radiant, glorious, swift their flight!<br>
Now the long, long darkness ends.<br>
Yet ye wail, my foolish friends,<br>
While the man whom ye call "dead"<br>
In unbroken bliss instead<br>
Lives, and loves you: lost, 'tis true<br>
By any light which shines for you;<br>
But in light ye cannot see<br>
Of unfulfilled felicity,<br>
And enlarging Paradise;<br>
Lives the life that never dies.<br>
<br>
Farewell, friends! Yet not farewell;<br>
Where I am, ye, too, shall dwell.<br>
I am gone before your face<br>
A heart-beat's time, a gray ant's pace.<br>
When ye come where I have stepped,<br>
Ye will marvel why ye wept;<br>
Ye will know, by true love taught,<br>
That here is all, and there is naught.<br>
Weep awhile, if ye are fain,--<br>
Sunshine still must follow rain!<br>
Only not at death, for death--<br>
Now I see--is that first breath<br>
Which our souls draw when we enter<br>
Life, that is of all life centre.<br>

<blockquote><i>Say Ar-Raheen! call Him "Compassionate,"</i><br>
<i>For He is pitiful to small and great</i>.<br>
'Tis written that the serving angels stand<br>
Beside God's throne, ten myriads on each hand,<br>
Waiting, with wings outstretched and watchful eyes,<br>
To do their Master's heavenly embassies.<br>
Quicker than thought His high commands they read,<br>
Swifter than light to execute them speed;<br>
Bearing the word of power from star to star,<br>
Some hither and some thither, near and far.<br>
And unto these naught is too high or low,<br>
Too mean or mighty, if He wills it so;<br>
Neither is any creature, great or small,<br>
Beyond His pity, which embraceth all,<br>
Because His eye beholdeth all which are;<br>
Sees without search, and counteth without care.<br>
Nor lies the babe nearer the nursing-place<br>
Than Allah's smallest child to Allah's grace;<br>
Nor any ocean rolls so vast that He<br>
Forgets one wave of all that restless sea.<br>
<br>
Thus it is written; and moreover told<br>
How Gabriel, watching by the Gates of Gold,<br>
Heard from the Voice Ineffable this word<br>
Of twofold mandate uttered by the Lord:--<br>
"Go earthward! pass where Solomon hath made<br>
His pleasure-house, and sitteth there arrayed,<br>
Goodly and splendid--whom I crowned the king.<br>
For at this hour my servant doth a thing<br>
Unfitting: out of Nisibis there came<br>
A thousand steeds with nostrils all aflame<br>
And limbs of swiftness, prizes of the fight;<br>
Lo! these are led, for Solomon's delight,<br>
Before the palace, where he gazeth now<br>
Filling his heart with pride at that brave show;<br>
So taken with the snorting and the tramp<br>
Of his war-horses, that Our silver lamp<br>
Of eve is swung in vain, Our warning Sun<br>
Will sink before his sunset-prayer's begun;<br>
So shall the people say, 'This king, our lord,<br>
Loves more the long-maned trophies of his sword<br>
Than the remembrance of his God!' Go in!<br>
Save thou My faithful servant from such sin.<br>
<br>
"Also, upon the slope of Arafat,<br>
Beneath a lote-tree which is fallen flat,<br>
Toileth a yellow ant who carrieth home<br>
Food for her nest, but so far hath she come<br>
Her worn feet fail, and she will perish, caught<br>
In the falling rain; but thou, make the way naught-And<br>
help her to her people in the cleft<br>
Of the black rock."<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Silently Gabriel left<br>
The Presence, and prevented the king's sin,<br>
And holp the little ant at entering in.<br>

<h2><a name="MATTHEW_ARNOLD"></a>MATTHEW ARNOLD</h2>
<h3>(1822-1888)</h3>
<h3>BY GEORGE EDWARD WOODBERRY</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-m.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>atthew Arnold, an English poet and critic, was born December
24th, 1822, at Laleham, in the Thames valley. He was the son of Dr.
Thomas Arnold, best remembered as the master of Rugby in later
years, and distinguished also as a historian of Rome. His mother
was, by her maiden name, Mary Penrose, and long survived her
husband. Arnold passed his school days at Winchester and Rugby, and
went to Oxford in October, 1841. There, as also at school, he won
scholarship and prize, and showed poetical talent. He was elected a
fellow of Oriel in March, 1845. He taught for a short time at
Rugby, but in 1847 became private secretary to Lord Lansdowne, who
in 1851 appointed him school inspector. From that time he was
engaged mainly in educational labors, as inspector and
commissioner, and traveled frequently on the Continent examining
foreign methods. He was also interested controversially in
political and religious questions of the day, and altogether had a
sufficient public life outside of literature. In 1851 he married
Frances Lucy, daughter of Sir William Wightman, a judge of the
Court of Queen's Bench, and by her had five children, three sons
and two daughters.</p>
<p>His first volume of verse, 'The Strayed Reveller and Other
Poems,' bears the date 1849; the second, 'Empedocles on Etna and
Other Poems,' 1852; the third, 'Poems,' made up mainly from the two
former, was published in 1853, and thereafter he added little to
his poetic work. His first volume of similar significance in prose
was 'Essays in Criticism,' issued in 1865. Throughout his mature
life he was a constant writer, and his collected works of all kinds
now fill eleven volumes, exclusive of his letters. In 1857 he was
elected Professor of Poetry at Oxford, and there began his career
as a lecturer; and this method of public expression he employed
often. His life was thus one with many diverse activities, and
filled with practical or literary affairs; and on no side was it
deficient in human relations. He won respect and reputation while
he lived; and his works continue to attract men's minds, although
with much unevenness. He died at Liverpool, on April 15th,
1888.</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illus0844.jpg" width="45%" alt=

<br>
<p>That considerable portion of Arnold's writings which was
concerned with education and politics, or with phases of
theological thought and religious tendency, however valuable in
contemporary discussion, and to men and movements of the third
quarter of the century, must be set on one side. It is not because
of anything there contained that he has become a permanent figure
of his time, or is of interest in literature. He achieved
distinction as a critic and as a poet; but although he was earlier
in the field as a poet, he was recognized by the public at large
first as a critic. The union of the two functions is not unusual in
the history of literature; but where success has been attained in
both, the critic has commonly sprung from the poet in the man, and
his range and quality have been limited thereby. It was so with
Dryden and Wordsworth, and, less obviously, with Landor and Lowell.
In Arnold's case there is no such growth: the two modes of writing,
prose and verse, were disconnected. One could read his essays
without suspecting a poet, and his poems without discerning a
critic, except so far as one finds the moralist there. In fact,
Arnold's critical faculty belonged rather to the practical side of
his life, and was a part of his talents as a public man.</p>
<p>This appears by the very definitions that he gave, and by the
turn of his phrase, which always keeps an audience rather than a
meditative reader in view. "What is the function of criticism at
the present time?" he asks, and answers--"A disinterested endeavor
to learn and propagate the best that is known and thought in the
world." That is a wide warrant. The writer who exercises his
critical function under it, however, is plainly a reformer at
heart, and labors for the social welfare. He is not an analyst of
the form of art for its own sake, or a contemplator of its
substance of wisdom or beauty merely. He is not limited to
literature or the other arts of expression, but the world--the
intellectual world--is all before him where to choose; and having
learned the best that is known and thought, his second and
manifestly not inferior duty is to go into all nations, a messenger
of the propaganda of intelligence. It is a great mission, and nobly
characterized; but if criticism be so defined, it is criticism of a
large mold.</p>
<p>The scope of the word conspicuously appears also in the phrase,
which became proverbial, declaring that literature is "a criticism
of life." In such an employment of terms, ordinary meanings
evaporate: and it becomes necessary to know the thought of the
author rather than the usage of men. Without granting the dictum,
therefore, which would be far from the purpose, is it not clear
that by "critic" and "criticism" Arnold intended to designate, or
at least to convey, something peculiar to his own conception,--not
strictly related to literature at all, it may be, but more closely
tied to society in its general mental activity? In other words,
Arnold was a critic of civilization more than of books, and aimed
at illumination by means of ideas. With this goes his manner,--that
habitual air of telling you something which you did not know
before, and doing it for your good,--which stamps him as a preacher
born. Under the mask of the critic is the long English face of the
gospeler; that type whose persistent physiognomy was never absent
from the conventicle of English thought.</p>
<p>This evangelizing prepossession of Arnold's mind must be
recognized in order to understand alike his attitude of
superiority, his stiffly didactic method, and his success in
attracting converts in whom the seed proved barren. The first
impression that his entire work makes is one of limitation; so
strict is this limitation, and it profits him so much, that it
seems the element in which he had his being. On a close survey, the
fewness of his ideas is most surprising, though the fact is
somewhat cloaked by the lucidity of his thought, its logical vigor,
and the manner of its presentation. He takes a text, either some
formula of his own or some adopted phrase that he has made his own,
and from that he starts out only to return to it again and again
with ceaseless iteration. In his illustrations, for example, when
he has pilloried some poor gentleman, otherwise unknown, for the
astounded and amused contemplation of the Anglican monocle, he
cannot let him alone. So too when, with the journalist's nack for
nicknames, he divides all England into three parts, he cannot
forget the rhetorical exploit. He never lets the points he has made
fall into oblivion; and hence his work in general, as a critic, is
skeletonized to the memory in watchwords, formulas, and nicknames,
which, taken altogether, make up only a small number of ideas.</p>
<p>His scale, likewise, is meagre. His essay is apt to be a book
review or a plea merely; it is without that free illusiveness and
undeveloped suggestion which indicate a full mind and give to such
brief pieces of writing the sense of overflow. He takes no large
subject as a whole, but either a small one or else some phases of
the larger one; and he exhausts all that he touches. He seems to
have no more to say. It is probable that his acquaintance with
literature was incommensurate with his reputation or apparent scope
as a writer. As he has fewer ideas than any other author of his
time of the same rank, so he discloses less knowledge of his own or
foreign literatures. His occupations forbade wide acquisition; he
husbanded his time, and economized also by giving the best
direction to his private studies, and he accomplished much; but he
could not master the field as any man whose profession was
literature might easily do. Consequently, in comparison with
Coleridge or Lowell, his critical work seems dry and bare, with
neither the fluency nor the richness of a master.</p>
<p>In yet another point this paucity of matter appears. What Mr.
Richard Holt Hutton says in his essay on the poetry of Arnold is so
apposite here that it will be best to quote the passage. He is
speaking, in an aside, of Arnold's criticisms:--</p>
<blockquote>"They are fine, they are keen, they are often true; but
they are always too much limited to the thin superficial layer of
the moral nature of their subjects, and seem to take little
comparative interest in the deeper individuality beneath. Read his
essay on Heine, and you will see the critic engrossed with the
relation of Heine to the political and social ideas of his day, and
passing over with comparative indifference the true soul of Heine,
the fountain of both his poetry and his cynicism. Read his five
lectures on translating Homer, and observe how exclusively the
critic's mind is occupied with the form as distinguished from the
substance of the Homeric poetry. Even when he concerns himself with
the greatest modern poets,--with Shakespeare as in the preface to
the earlier edition of his poems, or with Goethe in reiterated
poetical criticisms, or when he again and again in his poems treats
of Wordsworth,--it is always the style and superficial doctrine of
their poetry, not the individual character and unique genius, which
occupy him. He will tell you whether a poet is 'sane and clear,' or
stormy and fervent; whether he is rapid and noble, or loquacious
and quaint; whether a thinker penetrates the husks of conventional
thought which mislead the crowd; whether there is sweetness as well
as lucidity in his aims; whether a descriptive writer has
'distinction' of style, or is admirable only for his vivacity: but
he rarely goes to the individual heart of any of the subjects of
his criticism; he finds their style and class, but not their
personality in that class; he <i>ranks</i> his men, but does not
portray them; hardly even seems to find much interest in the
<i>individual</i> roots of their character."</blockquote>
<p>In brief, this is to say that Arnold took little interest in
human nature; nor is there anything in his later essays on Byron,
Keats, Wordsworth, Milton, or Gray, to cause us to revise the
judgment on this point. In fact, so far as he touched on the
personality of Keats or Gray, to take the capital instances, he was
most unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>Arnold was not, then, one of those critics who are interested in
life itself, and through the literary work seize on the soul of the
author in its original brightness, or set forth the life-stains in
the successive incarnations of his heart and mind. Nor was he of
those who consider the work itself final, and endeavor simply to
understand it,--form and matter,--and so to mediate between genius
and our slower intelligence. He followed neither the psychological
nor the aesthetic method. It need hardly be said that he was born
too early to be able ever to conceive of literature as a phenomenon
of society, and its great men as only terms in an evolutionary
series. He had only a moderate knowledge of literature, and his
stock of ideas was small; his manner of speech was hard and dry,
there was a trick in his style, and his self-repetition is
tiresome.</p>
<p>What gave him vogue, then, and what still keeps his more
literary work alive? Is it anything more than the temper in which
he worked, and the spirit which he evoked in the reader? He stood
for the very spirit of intelligence in his time. He made his
readers respect ideas, and want to have as many as possible. He
enveloped them in an atmosphere of mental curiosity and alertness,
and put them in contact with novel and attractive themes. In
particular, he took their minds to the Continent and made them feel
that they were becoming cosmopolitan by knowing Joubert; or at
home, he rallied them in opposition to the dullness of the period,
to "barbarism" or other objectionable traits in the social classes:
and he volleyed contempt upon the common multitudinous foe in
general, and from time to time cheered them with some delectable
examples of single combat. It cannot be concealed that there was
much malicious pleasure in it all. He was not indisposed to
high-bred cruelty. Like Lamb, he "loved a fool," but it was in a
mortar; and pleasant it was to see the spectacle when he really
took a man in hand for the chastisement of irony. It is thus that
"the <i>seraphim illuminati</i> sneer." And in all his
controversial writing there was a brilliancy and unsparingness that
will appeal to the deepest instincts of a fighting race,
willy-nilly; and as one had only to read the words to feel himself
among the children of light, so that our withers were unwrung,
there was high enjoyment.</p>
<p>This liveliness of intellectual conflict, together with the
sense of ideas, was a boon to youth especially; and the academic
air in which the thought and style always moved, with scholarly
self-possession and assurance, with the dogmatism of
"enlightenment" in all ages and among all sects, with serenity and
security unassailable, from within at least--this academic
"clearness and purity without shadow or stain" had an overpowering
charm to the college-bred and cultivated, who found the rare
combination of information, taste, and aggressiveness in one of
their own ilk. Above all, there was the play of intelligence on
every page; there was an application of ideas to life in many
regions of the world's interests; there was contact with a mind
keen, clear, and firm, armed for controversy or persuasion equally,
and filled with eager belief in itself, its ways, and its will.</p>
<p>To meet such personality in a book was a bracing experience; and
for many these essays were an awakening of the mind itself. We may
go to others for the greater part of what criticism can give,--for
definite and fundamental principles, for adequate characterization,
for the intuition and the revelation, the penetrant flash of
thought and phrase: but Arnold generates and supports a temper of
mind in which the work of these writers best thrives even in its
own sphere; and through him this temper becomes less individual
than social, encompassing the whole of life. Few critics have been
really less "disinterested," few have kept their eyes less steadily
"upon the object": but that fact does not lessen the value of his
precepts of disinterestedness and objectivity; nor is it necessary,
in becoming "a child of light," to join in spirit the unhappy
"remnant" of the academy, or to drink too deep of that honeyed
satisfaction, with which he fills his readers, of being on his
side. As a critic, Arnold succeeds if his main purpose does not
fail, and that was to reinforce the party of ideas, of culture, of
the children of light; to impart, not moral vigor, but openness and
reasonableness of mind; and to arouse and arm the intellectual in
contradistinction to the other energies of civilization.</p>
<p>The poetry of Arnold, to pass to the second portion of his work,
was less widely welcomed than his prose, and made its way very
slowly; but it now seems the most important and permanent part. It
is not small in quantity, though his unproductiveness in later
years has made it appear that he was less fluent and abundant in
verse than he really was. The remarkable thing, as one turns to his
poems, is the contrast in spirit that they afford to the essays:
there is here an atmosphere of entire calm. We seem to be in a
different world. This fact, with the singular silence of his
familiar letters in regard to his verse, indicates that his poetic
life was truly a thing apart.</p>
<p>In one respect only is there something in common between his
prose and verse: just as interest in human nature was absent in the
latter, it is absent also in the former. There is no action in the
poems; neither is there character for its own sake. Arnold was a
man of the mind, and he betrays no interest in personality except
for its intellectual traits; in Clough as in Obermann, it is the
life of thought, not the human being, that he portrays. As a poet,
he expresses the moods of the meditative spirit in view of nature
and our mortal existence; and he represents life, not lyrically by
its changeful moments, nor tragically by its conflict in great
characters, but philosophically by a self-contained and unvarying
monologue, deeper or less deep in feeling and with cadences of
tone, but always with the same grave and serious effect. He is
constantly thinking, whatever his subject or his mood; his attitude
is intellectual, his sentiments are maxims, his conclusions are
advisory. His world is the sphere of thought, and his poems have
the distance and repose and also the coldness that befit that
sphere; and the character of his imagination, which lays hold of
form and reason, makes natural to him the classical style.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the sources of his poetical culture are
Greek. It is not merely, however, that he takes for his early
subjects Merope and Empedocles, or that he strives in 'Balder Dead'
for Homeric narrative, or that in the recitative to which he was
addicted he evoked an immelodious phantom of Greek choruses; nor is
it the "marmoreal air" that chills while it ennobles much of his
finest work. One feels the Greek quality not as a source but as a
presence. In Tennyson, Keats, and Shelley, there was Greek
influence, but in them the result was modern. In Arnold the
antiquity remains; remains in mood, just as in Landor it remains in
form. The Greek twilight broods over all his poetry. It is pagan in
philosophic spirit; not Attic, but of a later and stoical time,
with the very virtues of patience, endurance, suffering, not in
their Christian types, but as they now seem to a post-Christian
imagination looking back to the imperial past. There is a
difference, it is true, in Arnold's expression of the mood: he is
as little Sophoclean as he is Homeric, as little Lucretian as he is
Vergilian. The temperament is not the same, not a survival or a
revival of the antique, but original and living. And yet the mood
of the verse is felt at once to be a reincarnation of the deathless
spirit of Hellas, that in other ages also has made beautiful and
solemn for a time the shadowed places of the Christian world. If
one does not realize this, he must miss the secret of the
tranquillity, the chill, the grave austerity, as well as the
philosophical resignation, which are essential to the verse. Even
in those parts of the poems which use romantic motives, one reason
of their original charm is that they suggest how the Greek
imagination would have dealt with the forsaken merman, the church
of Brou, and Tristram and Iseult. The presence of such motives,
such mythology, and such Christian and chivalric color in the work
of Arnold does not disturb the simple unity of its feeling, which
finds no solvent for life, whatever its accident of time and place
and faith, except in that Greek spirit which ruled in thoughtful
men before the triumph of Christianity, and is still native in men
who accept the intellect as the sole guide of life.</p>
<p>It was with reference to these modern men and the movement they
took part in, that he made his serious claim to greatness; to rank,
that is, with Tennyson and Browning, as he said, in the literature
of his time. "My poems," he wrote, "represent on the whole the main
movement of mind of the last quarter of a century; and thus they
will probably have their day as people become conscious to
themselves of what that movement of mind is, and interested in the
literary productions that reflect it. It might be fairly urged that
I have less poetical sentiment than Tennyson, and less intellectual
vigor and abundance than Browning; yet because I have, perhaps,
more of a fusion of the two than either of them, and have more
regularly applied that fusion to the main line of modern
development, I am likely enough to have my turn, as they have had
theirs." If the main movement had been such as he thought of it, or
if it had been of importance in the long run, there might be a
sounder basis for this hope than now appears to be the case; but
there can be no doubt, let the contemporary movement have been what
it may, that Arnold's mood is one that will not pass out of men's
hearts to-day nor to-morrow.</p>
<p>On the modern side the example of Wordsworth was most formative,
and in fact it is common to describe Arnold as a Wordsworthian: and
so, in his contemplative attitude to nature, and in his habitual
recourse to her, he was; but both nature herself as she appeared to
him, and his mood in her presence, were very different from
Wordsworth's conception and emotion. Arnold finds in nature a
refuge from life, an anodyne, an escape; but Wordsworth, in going
into the hills for poetical communion, passed from a less to a
fuller and deeper life, and obtained an inspiration, and was
seeking the goal of all his being. In the method of approach, too,
as well as in the character of the experience, there was a profound
difference between the two poets. Arnold sees with the outward
rather than the inward eye. He is pictorial in a way that
Wordsworth seldom is; he uses detail much more, and gives a group
or a scene with the externality of a painter. The method resembles
that of Tennyson rather than that of Wordsworth, and has more
direct analogy with the Greek manner than with the modern and
emotional schools; it is objective, often minute, and always
carefully composed, in the artistic sense of that term. The
description of the river Oxus, for example, though faintly charged
with suggested and allegoric meaning, is a noble close to the poem
which ends in it. The scale is large, and Arnold was fond of a
broad landscape, of mountains, and prospects over the land; but one
cannot fancy Wordsworth writing it. So too, on a small scale, the
charming scene of the English garden in 'Thyrsis' is far from
Wordsworth's manner:--</p>
<blockquote>"When garden walks and all the grassy floor<br>
With blossoms red and white of fallen May<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And chestnut-flowers are strewn--<br>
So have I heard the cuckoo's parting cry,<br>
From the wet field, through the vext garden trees,<br>
Come with the volleying rain and tossing breeze."</blockquote>
<p>This is a picture that could be framed: how different from
Wordsworth's "wandering voice"! Or to take another notable example,
which, like the Oxus passage, is a fine close in the 'Tristram and
Iseult,'--the hunter on the arras above the dead lovers:--</p>
<blockquote>"A stately huntsman, clad in green,<br>
And round him a fresh forest scene.<br>
On that clear forest-knoll he stays,<br>
With his pack round him, and delays.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
The wild boar rustles in his lair,<br>
The fierce hounds snuff the tainted air,<br>
But lord and hounds keep rooted there.<br>
Cheer, cheer thy dogs into the brake,<br>
O hunter! and without a fear<br>
Thy golden tasseled bugle blow"</blockquote>
<p>But no one is deceived, and the hunter does not move from the
arras, but is still "rooted there," with his green suit and his
golden tassel. The piece is pictorial, and highly wrought for
pictorial effects only, obviously decorative and used as stage
scenery precisely in the manner of our later theatrical art, with
that accent of forethought which turns the beautiful into the
aesthetic. This is a method which Wordsworth never used. Take one
of his pictures, the 'Reaper' for example, and see the difference.
The one is out-of-doors, the other is of the studio. The purpose of
these illustrations is to show that Arnold's nature-pictures are
not only consciously artistic, with an arrangement that approaches
artifice, but that he is interested through his eye primarily and
not through his emotions. It is characteristic of his temperament
also that he reminds one most often of the painter in
water-colors.</p>
<p>If there is this difference between Arnold and Wordsworth in
method, a greater difference in spirit is to be anticipated. It is
a fixed gulf. In nature Wordsworth found the one spirit's "plastic
stress," and a near and intimate revelation to the soul of truths
that were his greatest joy and support in existence. Arnold finds
there no inhabitancy of God, no such streaming forth of wisdom and
beauty from the fountain heads of being; but the secret frame of
nature is filled only with the darkness, the melancholy, the
waiting endurance that is projected from himself:--</p>
<blockquote>"Yet, Fausta, the mute turf we tread,<br>
The solemn hills about us spread,<br>
The stream that falls incessantly,<br>
The strange-scrawled rocks, the lonely sky,<br>
If I might lend their life a voice,<br>
Seem to bear rather than rejoice."</blockquote>
<p>Compare this with Wordsworth's 'Stanzas on Peele Castle,' and
the important reservations that must be borne in mind in describing
Arnold as a Wordsworthian will become clearer. It is as a relief
from thought, as a beautiful and half-physical diversion, as a
scale of being so vast and mysterious as to reduce the pettiness of
human life to nothingness,--it is in these ways that nature has
value in Arnold's verse. Such a poet may describe natural scenes
well, and obtain by means of them contrast to human conditions, and
decorative beauty; but he does not penetrate nature or interpret
what her significance is in the human spirit, as the more emotional
poets have done. He ends in an antithesis, not in a synthesis, and
both nature and man lose by the divorce. One looks in vain for
anything deeper than landscapes in Arnold's treatment of nature;
she is emptied of her own infinite, and has become spiritually
void: and in the simple great line in which he gave the sea--</p>
<blockquote>"The unplumbed, salt, estranging sea--"</blockquote>
<p>he is thinking of man, not of the ocean: and the mood seems
ancient rather than modern, the feeling of a Greek, just as the
sound of the waves to him is always Aegean.</p>
<p>In treating of man's life, which must be the main thing in any
poet's work, Arnold is either very austere or very pessimistic. If
the feeling is moral, the predominant impression is of austerity;
if it is intellectual, the predominant impression is of sadness. He
was not insensible to the charm of life, but he feels it in his
senses only to deny it in his mind. The illustrative passage is
from 'Dover Beach':--</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ah, love, let us be true<br>
To one another! for the world which seems<br>
To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So various, so beautiful, so new,<br>
Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br>
Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain."</blockquote>
<p>This is the contradiction of sense and thought, the voice of a
regret grounded in the intellect (for if it were vital and grounded
in the emotions it would become despair); the creed of illusion and
futility in life, which is the characteristic note of Arnold, and
the reason of his acceptance by many minds. The one thing about
life which he most insists on is its isolation, its individuality.
In the series called 'Switzerland,' this is the substance of the
whole; and the doctrine is stated with an intensity and power, with
an amplitude and prolongation, that set these poems apart as the
most remarkable of all his lyrics. From a poet so deeply impressed
with this aspect of existence, and unable to find its remedy or its
counterpart in the harmony of life, no joyful or hopeful word can
be expected, and none is found. The second thing about life which
he dwells on is its futility; though he bids one strive and work,
and points to the example of the strong whom he has known, yet one
feels that his voice rings more true when he writes of Obermann
than in any other of the elegiac poems. In such verse as the
'Summer Night,' again, the genuineness of the mood is indubitable.
In 'The Sick King of Bokhara,' the one dramatic expression of his
genius, futility is the very centre of the action. The fact that so
much of his poetry seems to take its motive from the subsidence of
Christian faith has set him among the skeptic or agnostic poets,
and the "main movement" which he believed he had expressed was
doubtless that in which agnosticism was a leading element. The
unbelief of the third quarter of the century was certainly a
controlling influence over him, and in a man mainly intellectual by
nature it could not well have been otherwise.</p>
<p>Hence, as one looks at his more philosophical and lyrical
poems--the profounder part of his work--and endeavors to determine
their character and sources alike, it is plain to see that in the
old phrase, "the pride of the intellect" lifts its lonely column
over the desolation of every page. The man of the academy is here,
as in the prose, after all. He reveals himself in the literary
motive, the bookish atmosphere of the verse, in its vocabulary, its
elegance of structure, its precise phrase and its curious allusions
(involving footnotes), and in fact, throughout all its form and
structure. So self-conscious is it that it becomes frankly prosaic
at inconvenient times, and is more often on the level of eloquent
and graceful rhetoric than of poetry. It is frequently liquid and
melodious, but there is no burst of native song in it anywhere. It
is the work of a true poet, nevertheless; but there are many voices
for the Muse. It is sincere, it is touched with reality; it is the
mirror of a phase of life in our times, and not in our times only,
but whenever the intellect seeks expression for its sense of the
limitation of its own career, and its sadness in a world which it
cannot solve.</p>
<p>A word should be added concerning the personality of Arnold
which is revealed in his familiar letters,--a collection that has
dignified the records of literature with a singularly noble memory
of private life. Few who did not know Arnold could have been
prepared for the revelation of a nature so true, so amiable, so
dutiful. In every relation of private life he is shown to have been
a man of exceptional constancy and plainness. The letters are
mainly home letters; but a few friendships also yielded up their
hoard, and thus the circle of private life is made complete. Every
one must take delight in the mental association with Arnold in the
scenes of his existence, thus daily exposed, and in his family
affections. A nature warm to its own, kindly to all, cheerful, fond
of sport and fun, and always fed from pure fountains, and with it a
character so founded upon the rock, so humbly serviceable, so
continuing in power and grace, must wake in all the responses of
happy appreciation, and leave the charm of memory.</p>
<p>He did his duty as naturally as if it required neither resolve,
nor effort, nor thought of any kind for the morrow, and he never
failed, seemingly, in act or word of sympathy, in little or great
things; and when, to this, one adds the clear ether of the
intellectual life where he habitually moved in his own life apart,
and the humanity of his home, the gift that these letters bring may
be appreciated. That gift is the man himself; but set in the
atmosphere of home, with son-ship and fatherhood, sisters and
brothers, with the bereavements of years fully accomplished, and
those of babyhood and boyhood,--a sweet and wholesome English home,
with all the cloud and sunshine of the English world drifting over
its roof-tree, and the soil of England beneath its stones, and
English duties for the breath of its being. To add such a home to
the household-rights of English literature is perhaps something
from which Arnold would have shrunk, but it endears his memory.</p>

<h2><a name="INTELLIGENCE_AND_GENIUS"></a>INTELLIGENCE AND
GENIUS</h2>
<center>From 'Essays in Criticism'</center>
<br>
<p>What are the essential characteristics of the spirit of our
nation? Not, certainly, an open and clear mind, not a quick and
flexible intelligence. Our greatest admirers would not claim for us
that we have these in a pre-eminent degree; they might say that we
had more of them than our detractors gave us credit for, but they
would not assert them to be our essential characteristics. They
would rather allege, as our chief spiritual characteristics, energy
and honesty; and if we are judged favorably and positively, not
invidiously and negatively, our chief characteristics are no doubt
these: energy and honesty, not an open and clear mind, not a quick
and flexible intelligence. Openness of mind and flexibility of
intelligence were very signal characteristics of the Athenian
people in ancient times; everybody will feel that. Openness of mind
and flexibility of intelligence are remarkable characteristics of
the French people in modern times,--at any rate, they strikingly
characterize them as compared with us; I think everybody, or almost
everybody, will feel that. I will not now ask what more the
Athenian or the French spirit has than this, nor what shortcomings
either of them may have as a set-off against this; all I want now
to point out is that they have this, and that we have it in a much
lesser degree.</p>
<p>Let me remark, however, that not only in the moral sphere, but
also in the intellectual and spiritual sphere, energy and honesty
are most important and fruitful qualities; that for instance, of
what we call genius, energy is the most essential part. So, by
assigning to a nation energy and honesty as its chief spiritual
characteristics,--by refusing to it, as at all eminent
characteristics, openness of mind and flexibility of
intelligence,--we do not by any means, as some people might at
first suppose, relegate its importance and its power of manifesting
itself with effect from the intellectual to the moral sphere. We
only indicate its probable special line of successful activity in
the intellectual sphere, and, it is true, certain imperfections and
failings to which in this sphere it will always be subject. Genius
is mainly an affair of energy, and poetry is mainly an affair of
genius; therefore a nation whose spirit is characterized by energy
may well be eminent in poetry;--and we have Shakespeare. Again, the
highest reach of science is, one may say, an inventive power, a
faculty of divination, akin to the highest power exercised in
poetry; therefore a nation whose spirit is characterized by energy
may well be eminent in science;--and we have Newton. Shakespeare
and Newton: in the intellectual sphere there can be no higher
names. And what that energy, which is the life of genius, above
everything demands and insists upon, is freedom; entire
independence of all authority, prescription, and routine,--the
fullest room to expand as it will. Therefore a nation whose chief
spiritual characteristic is energy will not be very apt to set up,
in intellectual matters, a fixed standard, an authority, like an
academy. By this it certainly escapes certain real inconveniences
and dangers; and it can at the same time, as we have seen, reach
undeniably splendid heights in poetry and science.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some of the requisites of intellectual work
are specially the affair of quickness of mind and flexibility of
intelligence. The form, the method of evolution, the precision, the
proportions, the relations of the parts to the whole, in an
intellectual work, depend mainly upon them. And these are the
elements of an intellectual work which are really most communicable
from it, which can most be learned and adopted from it, which have
therefore the greatest effect upon the intellectual performance of
others. Even in poetry these requisites are very important; and the
poetry of a nation not eminent for the gifts on which they depend,
will more or less suffer by this shortcoming. In poetry, however,
they are after all secondary, and energy is the first thing; but in
prose they are of first-rate importance. In its prose literature,
therefore, and in the routine of intellectual work generally, a
nation with no particular gifts for these will not be so
successful. These are what, as I have said, can to a certain degree
be learned and appropriated, while the free activity of genius
cannot. Academies consecrate and maintain them, and therefore a
nation with an eminent turn for them naturally establishes
academies. So far as routine and authority tend to embarrass energy
and inventive genius, academies may be said to be obstructive to
energy and inventive genius, and to this extent to the human
spirit's general advance. But then this evil is so much compensated
by the propagation, on a large scale, of the mental aptitudes and
demands which an open mind and a flexible intelligence naturally
engender, genius itself in the long run so greatly finds its
account in this propagation, and bodies like the French Academy
have such power for promoting it, that the general advance of the
human spirit is perhaps, on the whole, rather furthered than
impeded by their existence.</p>
<p>How much greater is our nation in poetry than prose! how much
better, in general, do the productions of its spirit show in the
qualities of genius than in the qualities of intelligence! One may
constantly remark this in the work of individuals: how much more
striking, in general, does any Englishman--of some vigor of mind,
but by no means a poet--seem in his verse than in his prose! His
verse partly suffers from his not being really a poet, partly no
doubt from the very same defects which impair his prose, and he
cannot express himself with thorough success in it, but how much
more powerful a personage does he appear in it, by dint of feeling
and of originality and movement of ideas, than when he is writing
prose! With a Frenchman of like stamp, it is just the reverse: set
him to write poetry, he is limited, artificial, and impotent; set
him to write prose, he is free, natural, and effective. The power
of French literature is in its prose writers, the power of English
literature is in its poets. Nay, many of the celebrated French
poets depend wholly for their fame upon the qualities of
intelligence which they exhibit,--qualities which are the
distinctive support of prose; many of the celebrated English prose
writers depend wholly for their fame upon the qualities of genius
and imagination which they exhibit,--qualities which are the
distinctive support of poetry.</p>
<p>But as I have said, the qualities of genius are less
transferable than the qualities of intelligence; less can be
immediately learned and appropriated from their product; they are
less direct and stringent intellectual agencies, though they may be
more beautiful and divine. Shakespeare and our great Elizabethan
group were certainly more gifted writers than Corneille and his
group; but what was the sequel to this great literature, this
literature of genius, as we may call it, stretching from Marlowe to
Milton? What did it lead up to in English literature? To our
provincial and second-rate literature of the eighteenth century.
What, on the other hand, was the sequel to the literature of the
French "great century," to this literature of intelligence, as by
comparison with our Elizabethan literature we may call it; what did
it lead up to? To the French literature of the eighteenth century,
one of the most powerful and pervasive intellectual agencies that
have ever existed,--the greatest European force of the eighteenth
century. In science, again, we had Newton, a genius of the very
highest order, a type of genius in science if ever there was one.
On the continent, as a sort of counterpart to Newton, there was
Leibnitz; a man, it seems to me (though on these matters I speak
under correction), of much less creative energy of genius, much
less power of divination than Newton, but rather a man of admirable
intelligence, a type of intelligence in science if ever there was
one. Well, and what did they each directly lead up to in science?
What was the intellectual generation that sprang from each of them?
I only repeat what the men of science have themselves pointed out.
The man of genius was continued by the English analysts of the
eighteenth century, comparatively powerless and obscure followers
of the renowned master. The man of intelligence was continued by
successors like Bernoulli, Euler, Lagrange, and Laplace, the
greatest names in modern mathematics.</p>

<h2><a name="SWEETNESS_AND_LIGHT"></a>SWEETNESS AND LIGHT</h2>
<center>From 'Culture and Anarchy'</center>
<br>
<p>The disparagers of culture make its motive curiosity; sometimes,
indeed, they make its motive mere exclusiveness and vanity. The
culture which is supposed to plume itself on a smattering of Greek
and Latin is a culture which is begotten by nothing so intellectual
as curiosity; it is valued either out of sheer vanity and
ignorance, or else as an engine of social and class distinction,
separating its holder, like a badge or title, from other people who
have not got it. No serious man would call this <i>culture</i>, or
attach any value to it, as culture, at all. To find the real ground
for the very differing estimate which serious people will set upon
culture, we must find some motive for culture in the terms of which
may lie a real ambiguity; and such a motive the word
<i>curiosity</i> gives us.</p>
<p>I have before now pointed out that we English do not, like the
foreigners, use this word in a good sense as well as in a bad
sense. With us the word is always used in a somewhat disapproving
sense. A liberal and intelligent eagerness about the things of the
mind may be meant by a foreigner when he speaks of curiosity; but
with us the word always conveys a certain notion of frivolous and
unedifying activity. In the Quarterly Review, some little time ago,
was an estimate of the celebrated French critic, M. Sainte-Beuve;
and a very inadequate estimate it in my judgment was. And its
inadequacy consisted chiefly in this: that in our English way it
left out of sight the double sense really involved in the word
<i>curiosity</i>, thinking enough was said to stamp M. Sainte-Beuve
with blame if it was said that he was impelled in his operations as
a critic by curiosity, and omitting either to perceive that M.
Sainte-Beuve himself, and many other people with him, would
consider that this was praiseworthy and not blameworthy, or to
point out why it ought really to be accounted worthy of blame and
not of praise. For as there is a curiosity about intellectual
matters which is futile, and merely a disease, so there is
certainly a curiosity--a desire after the things of the mind simply
for their own sakes and for the pleasure of seeing them as they
are--which is, in an intelligent being, natural and laudable. Nay,
and the very desire to see things as they are implies a balance and
regulation of mind which is not often attained without fruitful
effort, and which is the very opposite of the blind and diseased
impulse of mind which is what we mean to blame when we blame
curiosity. Montesquieu says:--"The first motive which ought to
impel us to study is the desire to augment the excellence of our
nature, and to render an intelligent being yet more intelligent."
This is the true ground to assign for the genuine scientific
passion, however manifested, and for culture, viewed simply as a
fruit of this passion; and it is a worthy ground, even though we
let the term <i>curiosity</i> stand to describe it.</p>
<p>But there is of culture another view, in which not solely the
scientific passion, the sheer desire to see things as they are,
natural and proper in an intelligent being, appears as the ground
of it. There is a view in which all the love of our neighbor, the
impulses toward action, help, and beneficence, the desire for
removing human error, clearing human confusion, and diminishing
human misery, the noble aspiration to leave the world better and
happier than we found it,--motives eminently such as are called
social,--come in as part of the grounds of culture, and the main
and pre-eminent part. Culture is then properly described not as
having its origin in curiosity, but as having its origin in the
love of perfection; it is <i>a study of perfection</i>. It moves by
the force, not merely or primarily of the scientific passion for
pure knowledge, but also of the moral and social passion for doing
good. As in the first view of it we took for its worthy motto
Montesquieu's words, "To render an intelligent being yet more
intelligent!" so in the second view of it there is no better motto
which it can have than these words of Bishop Wilson: "To make
reason and the will of God prevail."</p>
<p>Only, whereas the passion for doing good is apt to be over-hasty
in determining what reason and the will of God say, because its
turn is for acting rather than thinking, and it wants to be
beginning to act; and whereas it is apt to take its own
conceptions, which proceed from its own state of development and
share in all the imperfections and immaturities of this, for a
basis of action: what distinguishes culture is, that it is
possessed by the scientific passion as well as by the passion of
doing good; that it demands worthy notions of reason and the will
of God, and does not readily suffer its own crude conceptions to
substitute themselves for them. And knowing that no action or
institution can be salutary and stable which is not based on reason
and the will of God, it is not so bent on acting and instituting,
even with the great aim of diminishing human error and misery ever
before its thoughts, but that it can remember that acting and
instituting are of little use, unless we know how and what we ought
to act and to institute....</p>
<p>The pursuit of perfection, then, is the pursuit of sweetness and
light. He who works for sweetness and light, works to make reason
and the will of God prevail. He who works for machinery, he who
works for hatred, works only for confusion. Culture looks beyond
machinery, culture hates hatred; culture has one great passion, the
passion for sweetness and light. It has one even yet greater!--the
passion for making them <i>prevail.</i> It is not satisfied till we
<i>all</i> come to a perfect man; it knows that the sweetness and
light of the few must be imperfect until the raw and unkindled
masses of humanity are touched with sweetness and light. If I have
not shrunk from saying that we must work for sweetness and light,
so neither have I shrunk from saying that we must have a broad
basis, must have sweetness and light for as many as possible. Again
and again I have insisted how those are the happy moments of
humanity, how those are the marking epochs of a people's life, how
those are the flowering times for literature and art and all the
creative power of genius, when there is a <i>national</i> glow of
life and thought, when the whole of society is in the fullest
measure permeated by thought, sensible to beauty, intelligent and
alive. Only it must be <i>real</i> thought and <i>real</i> beauty;
<i>real</i> sweetness and <i>real</i> light. Plenty of people will
try to give the masses, as they call them, an intellectual food
prepared and adapted in the way they think proper for the actual
condition of the masses. The ordinary popular literature is an
example of this way of working on the masses. Plenty of people will
try to indoctrinate the masses with the set of ideas and judgments
constituting the creed of their own profession or party. Our
religious and political organizations give an example of this way
of working on the masses. I condemn neither way; but culture works
differently. It does not try to teach down to the level of inferior
classes; it does not try to win them for this or that sect of its
own, with ready-made judgments and watchwords. It seeks to do away
with classes; to make the best that has been thought and known in
the world current everywhere; to make all men live in an atmosphere
of sweetness and light, where they may use ideas, as it uses them
itself, freely,--nourished and not bound by them.</p>
<p>This is the <i>social idea</i>; and the men of culture are the
true apostles of equality. The great men of culture are those who
have had a passion for diffusing, for making prevail, for carrying
from one end of society to the other, the best knowledge, the best
ideas of their time; who have labored to divest knowledge of all
that was harsh, uncouth, difficult, abstract, professional,
exclusive; to humanize it, to make it efficient outside the clique
of the cultivated and learned, yet still remaining the <i>best</i>
knowledge and thought of the time, and a true source, therefore, of
sweetness and light. Such a man was Ab&eacute;lard in the Middle
Ages, in spite of all his imperfections; and thence the boundless
emotion and enthusiasm which Ab&eacute;lard excited. Such were
Lessing and Herder in Germany, at the end of the last century; and
their services to Germany were in this way inestimably precious.
Generations will pass, and literary monuments will accumulate, and
works far more perfect than the works of Lessing and Herder will be
produced in Germany; and yet the names of these two men will fill a
German with a reverence and enthusiasm such as the names of the
most gifted masters will hardly awaken. And why? Because they
<i>humanized</i> knowledge; because they broadened the basis of
life and intelligence; because they worked powerfully to diffuse
sweetness and light, to make reason and the will of God prevail.
With Saint Augustine they said:--"Let us not leave thee alone to
make in the secret of thy knowledge, as thou didst before the
creation of the firmament, the division of light from darkness; let
the children of thy spirit, placed in their firmament, make their
light shine upon the earth, mark the division of night and day, and
announce the revolution of the times; for the old order is passed,
and the new arises; the night is spent, the day is come forth; and
thou shalt crown the year with thy blessing, when thou shalt send
forth laborers into thy harvest sown by other hands than theirs;
when thou shalt send forth new laborers to new seed-times, whereof
the harvest shall be not yet."</p>
<p>Keeping this in view, I have in my own mind often indulged
myself with the fancy of employing, in order to designate our
aristocratic class, the name of <i>The Barbarians</i>. The
Barbarians, to whom we all owe so much, and who reinvigorated and
renewed our worn-out Europe, had, as is well known, eminent merits;
and in this country, where we are for the most part sprung from the
Barbarians, we have never had the prejudice against them which
prevails among the races of Latin origin. The Barbarians brought
with them that stanch individualism, as the modern phrase is, and
that passion for doing as one likes, for the assertion of personal
liberty, which appears to Mr. Bright the central idea of English
life, and of which we have at any rate a very rich supply. The
stronghold and natural seat of this passion was in the nobles of
whom our aristocratic class are the inheritors; and this class,
accordingly, have signally manifested it, and have done much by
their example to recommend it to the body of the nation, who
already, indeed, had it in their blood. The Barbarians, again, had
the passion for field-sports; and they have handed it on to our
aristocratic class, who of this passion, too, as of the passion for
asserting one's personal liberty, are the great natural stronghold.
The care of the Barbarians for the body, and for all manly
exercises; the vigor, good looks, and fine complexion which they
acquired and perpetuated in their families by these means,--all
this may be observed still in our aristocratic class. The chivalry
of the Barbarians, with its characteristics of high spirit, choice
manners, and distinguished bearing,--what is this but the
attractive commencement of the politeness of our aristocratic
class? In some Barbarian noble, no doubt, one would have admired,
if one could have been then alive to see it, the rudiments of our
politest peer. Only, all this culture (to call it by that name) of
the Barbarians was an exterior culture mainly. It consisted
principally in outward gifts and graces, in looks, manners,
accomplishments, prowess. The chief inward gifts which had part in
it were the most exterior, so to speak, of inward gifts, those
which come nearest to outward ones; they were courage, a high
spirit, self-confidence. Far within, and unawakened, lay a whole
range of powers of thought and feeling, to which these interesting
productions of nature had, from the circumstances of their life, no
access. Making allowances for the difference of the times, surely
we can observe precisely the same thing now in our aristocratic
class. In general its culture is exterior chiefly; all the exterior
graces and accomplishments, and the more external of the inward
virtues, seem to be principally its portion. It now, of course,
cannot but be often in contact with those studies by which, from
the world of thought and feeling, true culture teaches us to fetch
sweetness and light; but its hold upon these very studies appears
remarkably external, and unable to exert any deep power upon its
spirit. Therefore the one insufficiency which we noted in the
perfect mean of this class was an insufficiency of light. And owing
to the same causes, does not a subtle criticism lead us to make,
even on the good looks and politeness of our aristocratic class,
and of even the most fascinating half of that class, the feminine
half, the one qualifying remark, that in these charming gifts there
should perhaps be, for ideal perfection, a shade more
<i>soul</i>?</p>
<p>I often, therefore, when I want to distinguish clearly the
aristocratic class from the Philistines proper, or middle class,
name the former, in my own mind, <i>The Barbarians</i>. And when I
go through the country, and see this and that beautiful and
imposing seat of theirs crowning the landscape, "There," I say to
myself, "is a great fortified post of the Barbarians."</p>

<p>No, we are all seekers still! seekers often make mistakes, and I

thyself to sides and to heroes not mine, only never to the
Philistines! home of lost causes, and forsaken beliefs, and
unpopular names, and impossible loyalties! what example could ever
so inspire us to keep down the Philistine in ourselves, what
teacher could ever so save us from that bondage to which we are all
prone, that bondage which Goethe, in his incomparable lines on the
death of Schiller, makes it his friend's highest praise (and nobly
did Schiller deserve the praise) to have left miles out of sight
behind him: the bondage of "<i>was uns alle bandigt, Das
Gemeine!</i>" She will forgive me, even if I have unwittingly drawn
upon her a shot or two aimed at her unworthy son; for she is
generous, and the cause in which I fight is, after all, hers.
Apparitions of a day, what is our puny warfare against the
Philistines, compared with the warfare which this queen of romance
has been waging against them for centuries, and will wage after we
are gone?</p>

<p class="i6">When Byron's eyes were shut in death,</p>

<p class="i6">With shivering heart the strife we saw</p>
<p class="i6">Of passion with eternal law;</p>
<p class="i6">And yet with reverential awe</p>

<p class="i6">Goethe has done his pilgrimage.</p>
<p class="i6">He took the suffering human race,</p>
<p class="i7">He read each wound, each weakness clear;</p>
<p class="i6">And struck his finger on the place,</p>
<p class="i7">And said: Thou ailest here, and here!</p>
<p class="i6">He looked on Europe's dying hour</p>
<p class="i6">Of fitful dream and feverish power;</p>
<p class="i6">His eye plunged down the weltering strife,</p>
<p class="i6">The turmoil of expiring life--He</p>
<p class="i6">said, The end is everywhere,</p>
<p class="i6">Art still has truth, take refuge there!</p>
<p class="i6">And he was happy, if to know</p>
<p class="i6">Causes of things, and far below</p>
<p class="i6">His feet to see the lurid flow</p>
<p class="i6">Of terror, and insane distress,</p>

<p class="i6">Through Hades, and the mournful gloom.</p>
<p class="i6">Wordsworth has gone from us--and ye,</p>
<p class="i6">Ah, may ye feel his voice as we!</p>

<p class="i6">He found us when the age had bound</p>
<p class="i6">Our souls in its benumbing round;</p>
<p class="i7">He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.</p>
<p class="i6">He laid us as we lay at birth,</p>
<p class="i6">On the cool, flowery lap of earth.</p>
<p class="i6">Smiles broke from us and we had ease;</p>
<p class="i6">The hills were round us, and the breeze</p>

<p class="i6">But where will Europe's latter hour</p>
<p class="i6">Again find Wordsworth's healing power?</p>
<p class="i6">Others will teach us how to dare,</p>
<p class="i7">And against fear our breast to steel;</p>
<p class="i6">Others will strengthen us to bear--</p>
<p class="i7">But who, ah! who, will make us feel?</p>
<p class="i6">The cloud of mortal destiny,</p>
<p class="i6">Others will front it fearlessly--But</p>
<p class="i6">who, like him, will put it by?</p>
<p class="i6">Keep fresh the grass upon his grave,</p>
<p class="i6">O Rotha, with thy living wave!</p>

The tide is full, the moon lies fair<br>
Upon the straits;--on the French coast the light<br>
Gleams and is gone; the cliffs of England stand,<br>
Glimmering and vast, out in the tranquil bay.<br>
<br>
Come to the window, sweet is the night-air!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only, from the long line of spray<br>
Where the sea meets the moon-blanched sand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Listen! you hear the grating roar<br>
Of pebbles which the waves draw back, and fling,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;At their return, up the high strand,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Begin and cease, and then again begin,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With tremulous cadence slow, and bring<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eternal note of sadness in.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophocles long ago<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard it on the Aegean, and it brought<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Into his mind the turbid ebb and flow<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of human misery; we<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Find also in the sound a thought,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearing it by this distant northern sea.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sea of faith<br>
Was once, too, at the full, and round earth's shore<br>
Lay like the folds of a bright girdle furled.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But now I only hear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Its melancholy, long, withdrawing roar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retreating, to the breath<br>
Of the night-wind, down the vast edges drear<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And naked shingles of the world.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, love, let us be true<br>
To one another! for the world, which seems<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To lie before us like a land of dreams,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So various, so beautiful, so new,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hath really neither joy, nor love, nor light,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help for pain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And we are here as on a darkling plain<br>
Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight,<br>

night.</blockquote>

And a look of passionate desire<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O'er the sea and to the stars I send:<br>
"Ye who from my childhood up have calmed me,<br>

The moon! and lost behind her, fading dim<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down at the far horizon's rim,<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And the calm moonlight seems to say:--<br>
Hast thou then still the old unquiet breast,<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still to be what I am, or yield, and be<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like all the other men I see.<br>
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where, in the sun's hot
eye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With heads bent o'er their toil, they languidly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their lives to some unmeaning taskwork give,<br>

<h2><a name="THE_ARTHURIAN_LEGENDS"></a>THE ARTHURIAN LEGENDS</h2>
<h3>(Eighth to Twelfth Centuries)</h3>
<h3>BY RICHARD JONES</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-f.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>or nearly a thousand years, the Arthurian legends, which lie at
the basis of Tennyson's 'Idylls of the King,' have furnished
unlimited literary material, not to English poets alone, but to the
poets of all Christendom. These Celtic romances, having their
birthplace in Brittany or in Wales, had been growing and changing
for some centuries, before the fanciful 'Historia Britonum' of
Geoffrey of Monmouth flushed them with color and filled them with
new life. Through the version of the good Benedictine they soon
became a vehicle for the dissemination of Christian doctrine. By
the year 1200 they were the common property of Europe, influencing
profoundly the literature of the Middle Ages, and becoming the
source of a great stream of poetry that has flowed without
interruption down to our own day.</p>
<p>Sixty years after the 'Historia Britonum' appeared, and when the
English poet Layamon wrote his 'Brut' (A.D. 1205), which was a
translation of Wace, as Wace was a translation of Geoffrey, the
theme was engrossing the imagination of Europe. It had absorbed
into itself the elements of other cycles of legend, which had grown
up independently; some of these, in fact, having been at one time
of much greater prominence. Finally, so vast and so complicated did
the body of Arthurian legend become, that summaries of the
essential features were attempted. Such a summary was made in
French about 1270, by the Italian Rustighello of Pisa; in German,
about two centuries later, by Ulrich F&uuml;terer; and in English
by Sir Thomas Malory in his 'Morte d'Arthur,' finished "the ix.
yere of the reygne of kyng Edward the Fourth," and one of the first
books published in England by Caxton, "emprynted and fynysshed in
th'abbey Westmestre the last day of July, the yere of our Lord
MCCCCLXXXV." It is of interest to note, as an indication of the
popularity of the Arthurian legends, that Caxton printed the 'Morte
d'Arthur' eight years before he printed any portion of the English
Bible, and fifty-three years before the complete English Bible was
in print. He printed the 'Morte d'Arthur' in response to a general
"demaund"; for "many noble and dyvers gentylmen of thys royame of
England camen and demaunded me many and oftymes wherefore that I
have not do make and enprynte the noble hystorye of the saynt
greal, and of the moost renomed crysten kyng, fyrst and chyef of
the thre best crysten and worthy, kyng Arthur, whyche ought moost
to be remembred emonge us Englysshe men tofore al other crysten
kynges."</p>
<p>Nor did poetic treatment of the theme then cease. Dante, in the
'Divine Comedy,' speaks by name of Arthur, Guinevere, Tristan, and
Launcelot. In that touching interview in the second cycle of the
Inferno between the poet and Francesca da Rimini, which Carlyle has
called "a thing woven out of rainbows on a ground of eternal
black," Francesca replies to Dante, who was bent to know the primal
root whence her love for Paolo gat being:--</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One
day<br>
For our delight, we read of Launcelot,<br>
How him love thralled. Alone we were, and no<br>
Suspicion near us. Oft-times by that reading<br>
Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue<br>
Fled from our altered cheek. But at one point<br>
Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,<br>
The wished smile, rapturously kissed<br>
By one so deep in love, then he, who ne'er<br>
From me shall separate, at once my lips<br>
All trembling kissed. The book and writer both<br>
Were love's purveyors. In its leaves that day<br>
We read no more."</blockquote>
<p>This poetic material was appropriated also by the countrymen of
Dante, Boiardo, Ariosto, and Tasso, by Hans Sachs in Germany, by
Spenser, Shakespeare, and Milton in England. As Sir Walter Scott
has sung:--</p>
<blockquote>"The mightiest chiefs of British song<br>
Scorned not such legends to prolong."</blockquote>
<p>Roger Ascham, it is true, has, in his 'Scholemaster' (1570
A.D.), broken a lance against this body of fiction. "In our
forefathers' tyme," wrote he, "whan Papistrie, as a standyng poole,
couered and ouerflowed all England, fewe bookes were read in our
tong, sauyng certaine bookes of Cheualrie, as they sayd, for
pastime and pleasure, which, as some say, were made in Monasteries,
by idle Monkes, or wanton Chanons; as one for example, 'Morte
Arthure': the whole pleasure of which booke standeth in two
speciall poyntes, in open mans slaughter, and bold bawdrye: in
which booke those be counted the noblest Knights, that do kill most
men without any quarrell, and commit foulest aduoulteries by
sutlest shiftes."</p>
<p>But Roger's characterization of "the whole pleasure of which
booke" was not just, nor did it destroy interest in the theme. "The
generall end of all the booke," said Spenser of the 'Faerie
Queene,' "is to fashion a gentleman or noble person in vertuous and
gentle discipline;" and for this purpose he therefore "chose the
historye of King Arthure, as most fitte for the excellency of his
person, being made famous by many men's former workes, and also
furthest from the daunger of envie, and suspition of present
tyme."</p>
<p>The plots for Shakespeare's 'King Lear' and 'Cymbeline' came
from Geoffrey's 'Historia Britonum,' as did also the story of
'Gorboduc,' the first tragedy in the English language. Milton
intended at one time that the subject of the great poem for which
he was "pluming his wings" should be King Arthur, as may be seen,
in his 'Mansus' and 'Epitaphium Damonis.' Indeed, he did touch the
lyre upon this theme,--lightly, it is true, but firmly enough to
justify Swinburne's lines:--</p>
<blockquote>"Yet Milton's sacred feet have lingered there,<br>
His lips have made august the fabulous air,<br>
His hands have touched and left the wild weeds fair."</blockquote>
<p>But his duties as Latin Secretary to the Commonwealth diverted
him from poetry for many years, and when the Restoration gave him
leisure once more to court the Muse, he had come to doubt the
existence of the Celtic hero-king; for in 'Paradise Lost' (Book i.,
line 579) he refers to</p>
<blockquote>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"what
resounds<br>
In fable or romance of Uther's son;"</blockquote>
<p>and in his 'History of Britain' (1670 A.D.) he says
explicitly:--"For who Arthur was, and whether ever any such reign'd
in Britan, hath bin doubted heertofore, and may again with good
reason."</p>
<p>Dryden, who composed the words of an opera on King Arthur,
meditated, according to Sir Walter Scott, a larger treatment of the
theme:--</p>
<blockquote>"And Dryden in immortal strain<br>
Had raised the Table Round again,<br>
But that a ribald King and Court<br>
Bade him toil on to make them sport."</blockquote>
<p>Sir Walter himself edited the old metrical romance of 'Sir
Tristram,' and where the manuscript was defective, composed a
portion after the manner of the original, the portion in which
occur the lines,</p>
<blockquote>"Mi schip do thou take,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With godes that bethe new;<br>
Two seyles do thou make,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Beth different in hewe:<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
"Ysoude of Britanye,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With the white honde,<br>
The schip she can se,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Seyling to londe;<br>
The white seyl tho marked sche.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 25%;">
<br>
<br>
"Fairer ladye ere<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Did Britannye never spye,<br>
Swiche murning chere,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Making on heighe;<br>
On Tristremes bere,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Doun con she lye;<br>
Rise ogayn did sche nere,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thare con sche dye<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For woe;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Swiche lovers als thei<br>
Never schal be moe."</blockquote>
<p>Of the poets of the present generation, Tennyson has treated the
Arthurian poetic heritage as a whole. Phases of the Arthurian theme
have been presented also by his contemporaries and successors at
home and abroad,--by William Wordsworth, Lord Lytton, Robert
Stephen Hawker, Matthew Arnold, William Morris, Algernon Charles
Swinburne, in England; Edgar Quinet in France; Wilhelm Hertz, L.
Schneegans, F. Roeber, in Germany; Richard Hovey in America. There
have been many other approved variations on Arthurian themes, such
as James Russell Lowell's 'Vision of Sir Launfal,' and Richard
Wagner's operas, 'Lohengrin,' 'Tristan and Isolde,' and 'Parsifal.'
Of still later versions, we may mention the 'King Arthur' of J.
Comyns Carr, which has been presented on the stage by Sir Henry
Irving; and 'Under King Constantine,' by Katrina Trask, whose hero
is the king whom tradition names as the successor of the heroic
Arthur, "Imperator, Dux Bellorum."</p>
<p>This poetic material is manifestly a living force in the
literature of the present day. And we may well remind ourselves of
the rule which should govern our verdict in regard to the new
treatments of the theme as they appear. This century-old
'Dichterstoff,' this poetic treasure-store through which speaks the
voice of the race, this great body of accumulated poetic material,
is a heritage; and it is evident that whoever attempts any phase of
this theme may not treat such subject-matter capriciously, nor
otherwise than in harmony with its inherent nature and spirit. It
is recognized that the stuff whereof great poetry is made is not
the arbitrary creation of the poet, and cannot be manufactured to
order. "Genuine poetic material," it has been said, "is handed down
in the imagination of man from generation to generation, changing
its spirit according to the spirit of each age, and reaching its
full development only when in the course of time the favorable
conditions coincide." Inasmuch as the subject-matter of the
Arthurian legends is not the creation of a single poet, nor even of
many poets, but is in fact the creation of the people,--indeed, of
many peoples widely separated in time and space, and is thus in a
sense the voice of the race,--it resembles in this respect the
Faust legends, which are the basis of Goethe's world-poem; or the
medi&aelig;val visions of a future state, which found their supreme
and final expression in Dante's 'Divina Commedia,' which sums up
within itself the art, the religion, the politics, the philosophy,
and the view of life of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>Whether the Arthurian legends as a whole have found their final
and adequate expression in Tennyson's 'Idylls of the King,' or
whether it was already too late, when the Laureate wrote, to create
from primitive ideas so simple a poem of the first rank, is not
within the province of this essay to discuss. But manifestly, any
final judgment in regard to the treatment of this theme as a whole,
or any phase of the theme, is inadequate which leaves out of
consideration the history of the subject-matter, and its treatment
by other poets; which, in short, ignores its possibilities and its
significance. With respect to the origin and the early history of
the Arthurian legend, much remains to be established. Whether its
original home was in Wales, or among the neighboring Celts across
the sea in Brittany, whither many of the Celts of Britain fled
after the Anglo-Saxon invasion of their island home, no one knows.
But to some extent, at least, the legend was common to both sides
of the Channel when Geoffrey wrote his book, about 1145. As a
matter of course, this King Arthur, the ideal hero of later ages,
was a less commanding personage in the early forms of the legend
than when it had acquired its splendid distinction by borrowing and
assimilating other mythical tales.</p>
<p>It appears that five great cycles of legend,--(1) the Arthur,
Guinevere, and Merlin cycle, (2) the Round Table cycle, (3) the
Holy Grail cycle, (4) the Launcelot cycle, (5) the Tristan
cycle,--which at first developed independently, were, in the latter
half of the twelfth century, merged together into a body of legend
whose bond of unity was the idealized Celtic hero, King Arthur.</p>

<br>
<p>This blameless knight, whose transfigured memory has been thus
transmitted to us, was probably a leader of the Celtic tribes of
England in their struggles with the Saxon invaders. His victory at
Mount Badon, described by Sir Launcelot to the household at
Astolat,--</p>
<blockquote>"Dull days were those, till our good Arthur broke<br>
The pagan yet once more on Badon Hill,"--</blockquote>
<p>this victory is mentioned by Gildas, who wrote in the sixth
century. Gildas, however, though he mentions the occasion, does not
give the name of the leader. But Nennius, who wrote in the latter
part of the eighth century, or early in the ninth, makes Arthur the
chieftain, and adds an account of his great personal prowess. Thus
the Arthur legend has already begun to grow. For the desperate
struggle with the Saxons was vain. As the highly gifted,
imaginative Celt saw his people overwhelmed by the kinsmen of the
conquerors of Rome, he found solace in song for the hard facts of
life. In the fields of imagination he won the victories denied him
on the field of battle, and he clustered these triumphs against the
enemies of his race about the name and the person of the
magnanimous Arthur. When the descendants of the Saxons were in
their turn overcome by Norman conquerors, the heart of the Celtic
world was profoundly stirred. Ancient memories awoke, and, yearning
for the restoration of British greatness, men rehearsed the deeds
of him who had been king, and of whom it was prophesied that he
should be king hereafter. At this moment of newly awakened hope,
Geoffrey's 'Historia' appeared. His book was not in reality a
history. Possibly it was not even very largely founded on existing
legends. But in any case the chronicle of Geoffrey was a work of
genius and of imagination. "The figure of Arthur," says Ten Brink,
"now stood forth in brilliant light, a chivalrous king and hero,
endowed and guarded by supernatural powers, surrounded by brave
warriors and a splendid court, a man of marvelous life and a tragic
death."</p>
<p>Geoffrey's book was immediately translated into French by Robert
Wace, who incorporated with the legend of Arthur the Round Table
legend. In his 'Brut,' the English poet-priest Layamon reproduced
this feature of the legend with additional details. His chronicle
is largely a free translation of the 'Brut d'Engleterre' of Wace,
earlier known as 'Geste des Bretons.' Thus as Wace had reproduced
Geoffrey with additions and modifications, Layamon reproduced Wace.
So the story grew. In the mean time, other poets in other lands had
taken up the theme, connecting with it other cycles of legend
already in existence. In 1205, when Layamon wrote his 'Brut,'
unnumbered versions of the history of King Arthur, with which had
been woven the legend of the Holy Grail, had already appeared among
the principal nations of Europe. Of the early Arthurian poets, two
of the more illustrious and important are Chrestien de Troyes, in
France, of highest poetic repute, who opened the way for Tennyson,
and Wolfram von Eschenbach, in Germany, with his 'Parzival,' later
the theme of Wagner's greatest opera. The names of Robert de Borron
in France, Walter Map in England, and Heinrich von dem T&uuml;rlin
in Germany, may also be mentioned.</p>
<p>In divers lands, innumerable poets with diverse tastes set
themselves to make new versions of the legend. Characteristics of
the Arthurian tale were grafted upon an entirely different stock,
as was done by Boiardo in Italy, making confusion worse confounded
to the modern Arthurian scholar. Boiardo expressly says in the
'Orlando Innamorato' that his intention is to graft the
characteristics of the Arthurian cycle upon the Carlovingian French
national epic stock. He wished to please the courts, whose ideal
was not the paladins, but Arthur's knights. The "peers" of the
Charlemagne legend are thus transformed into knights-errant, who
fight for ladies and for honor. The result of this interpenetration
of the two cycles is a splendid world of love and <i>cortesia</i>,
whose constituent elements it defies the Arthurian scholar to
trace. Truly, as Dr. Sommer has said in his erudite edition of
Malory's 'La Morte d'Arthur.' "The origin and relationship to one
another of these branches of romance, whether in prose or in verse,
are involved in great obscurity." He adds that it would almost seem
as though several generations of scholars were required for the
gigantic task of finding a sure pathway through this intricate
maze. And M. Gaston Paris, one of the foremost of living Arthurian
scholars, has written in his 'Romania': "Some time ago I undertook
a methodical exploration in the grand poetical domain which is
called the cycle of the Round Table, the cycle of Arthur, or the
Breton cycle. I advance, groping along, and very often retracing my
steps twenty times over, I become aware that I am lost in a
pathless maze."</p>
<p>There is a question, moreover, whether Geoffrey's book is based
mainly upon inherited poetical material, or is largely the product
of Geoffrey's individual imagination. The elder Paris, M. Paulin
Paris, inclined to the view that Nennius, with hints from local
tales, supplied all the bases that Geoffrey had. But his son,
Professor Gaston Paris, in his 'Litt&eacute;rature Fran&ccedil;aise
au Moyen Age,' emphasizes the importance of the "Celtic"
contribution, as does also Mr. Alfred Nutt in his 'Studies in the
Arthurian Legend.' The former view emphasizes the individual
importance of Geoffrey; the latter view places the emphasis on the
legendary heritage. Referring to this so-called national poetry,
Ten Brink says:--</p>
<blockquote>"But herein lies the essential difference between that
age and our own: the result of poetical activity was not the
property and not the production of a single person, but of the
community. The work of the individual singer endured only as long
as its delivery lasted. He gained personal distinction only as a
virtuoso. The permanent elements of what he presented, the
material, the ideas, even the style and metre, already existed. The
work of the singer was only a ripple in the stream of national
poetry. Who can say how much the individual contributed to it, or
where in his poetical recitation &cedil;memory ceased and creative
impulse began! In any case the work of the individual lived on only
as the ideal possession of the aggregate body of the people, and it
soon lost the stamp of originality."</blockquote>
<p>When Geoffrey wrote, this period of national poetry was drawing
to a close; but it was not yet closed. Alfred Nutt, in his 'Studies
in the Legend of the Holy Grail,' speaking of Wolfram von
Eschenbach, who wrote his 'Parzival' about the time that the
'Nibelungenlied' was given its present form (<i>i.e.,</i> about a
half-century after Geoffrey), says:--"Compared with the unknown
poets who gave their present shape to the 'Nibelungenlied' or to
the 'Chanson de Roland,' he is an individual writer; but he is far
from deserving this epithet even in the sense that Chaucer deserves
it." Professor Rhys says, in his 'Studies in the Arthurian
Legend':--"Leaving aside for a while the man Arthur, and assuming
the existence of a god of that name, let us see what could be made
of him. Mythologically speaking, he would probably have to be
regarded as a Culture Hero," etc.</p>
<p>To summarize this discussion of the difficulties of the theme,
there are now existing, scattered throughout the libraries and the
monasteries of Europe, unnumbered versions of the Arthurian
legends. Some of these are early versions, some are late, and some
are intermediate. What is the relation of all these versions to one
another? Which are the oldest, and which are copies, and of what
versions are they copies? What is the land of their origin, and
what is the significance of their symbolism? These problems,
weighty in tracing the growth of medi&aelig;val
ideals,--<i>i.e.,</i> in tracing the development of the realities
of the present from the ideals of the past,--are still under
investigation by the specialists. The study of the Arthurian
legends is in itself a distinct branch of learning, which demands
the lifelong labors of scholarly devotees.</p>
<p>There now remains to consider the extraordinary spread of the
legend in the closing decades of the twelfth century and in the
century following. Though Tennyson has worthily celebrated as the
morning star of English song--</p>
<blockquote>"Dan Chaucer, the first warbler, whose sweet breath<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Preluded those melodious bursts that fill<br>
The spacious times of great Elizabeth<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With sounds that echo still."</blockquote>
<p>yet the centuries before Chaucer, far from being barren of
literature, were periods of rich poetical activity both in England
and on the Continent. Eleanor of Aquitaine, formerly Queen of
France,--who had herself gone on a crusade to the Holy Land, and
who, on returning, married in 1152 Henry of Anjou, who became in
1155 Henry II. of England,--was an ardent patroness of the art of
poetry, and personally aroused the zeal of poets. The famous
troubadour Bernard de Ventadorn--"with whom," says Ten Brink, "the
Proven&ccedil;al art-poesy entered upon the period of its
florescence"--followed her to England, and addressed to her his
impassioned verse. Wace, the Norman-French <i>trouvere</i>,
dedicated to her his 'Brut.' The ruling classes of England at this
time were truly cosmopolitan, familiar with the poetic material of
many lands. Jusserand, in his 'English Novel in the Time of
Shakespeare,' discussing a poem of the following century written in
French by a Norman monk of Westminster and dedicated to Eleanor of
Provence, wife of Henry III., says:--"Rarely was the like seen in
any literature: here is a poem dedicated to a Frenchwoman by a
Norman of England, which begins with the praise of a Briton, a
Saxon, and a Dane."</p>
<p>But the ruling classes of England were not the only
cosmopolitans, nor the only possessors of fresh poetic material.
Throughout Europe in general, the conditions were favorable for
poetic production. The Crusades had brought home a larger knowledge
of the world, and the stimulus of new experiences. Western princes
returned with princesses of the East as their brides, and these
were accompanied by splendid trains, including minstrels and poets.
Thus Europe gathered in new poetic material, which stimulated and
developed the poetical activity of the age. Furthermore, the
Crusades had aroused an intense idealism, which, as always,
demanded and found poetic expression. The dominant idea pervading
the earlier forms of the Charlemagne stories, the unswerving
loyalty due from a vassal to his lord,--that is, the feudal view of
life,--no longer found an echo in the hearts of men. The time was
therefore propitious for the development of a new cycle of
legend.</p>
<p>Though by the middle of the twelfth century the Arthurian legend
had been long in existence, and King Arthur had of late been
glorified by Geoffrey's book, the legend was not yet supreme in
popular interest. It became so through its association, a few years
later, with the legend of the Holy Grail,--the San Graal, the holy
vessel which received at the Cross the blood of Christ, which was
now become a symbol of the Divine Presence. This holy vessel had
been brought by Joseph of Arimathea from Palestine to Britain, but
was now, alas, vanished quite from the sight of man. It was the
holy quest for this sacred vessel, to which the knights of the
Round Table now bound themselves,--this "search for the
supernatural," this "struggle for the spiritual," this blending of
the spirit of Christianity with that of chivalry,--which
immediately transformed the Arthurian legend, and gave to its
heroes immortality. At once a new spirit breathes in the old
legend. In a few years it is become a mystical, symbolical,
anagogical tale, inculcating one of the profoundest dogmas of the
Holy Catholic Church, a bearer of a Christian doctrine engrossing
the thought of the Christian world. And inasmuch as the transformed
Arthurian legend now taught by implication the doctrine of the
Divine Presence, its spread was in every way furthered by the great
power of the Church, whose spiritual rulers made the minstrel
doubly welcome when celebrating this theme.</p>
<p>For there was heresy to be combated; viz., the heresy of the
scholastic theologian Berengar of Tours, who had attacked the
doctrine of the transubstantiation of the bread and the wine of the
Eucharist into the body and blood of Christ. Lanfranc, Archbishop
of Canterbury, one of the most brilliant of the Middle Age
theologians, felt impelled to reply to Berengar, who had been his
personal friend; and he did so in the 'Liber Scintillarum,' which
was a vigorous, indeed a violent, defense of the doctrine denied by
Berengar. Berengar died in 1088; but he left a considerable body of
followers. The heretics were anathematized by the Second Lateran
Ecumenical Council held in Rome in 1139. Again, in 1215, the Fourth
Lateran Council declared transubstantiation to be an article of
faith, and in 1264 a special holy day, Corpus Christi,--viz., the
first Thursday after Trinity Sunday,--was set apart to give an
annual public manifestation of the belief of the Church in the
doctrine of the Eucharist.</p>
<p>But when the Fourth Lateran Ecumenical Council met in 1215, the
transformation of the Arthurian legend by means of its association
with the legend of the Holy Grail was already complete, and the
transformed legend, now become a defender of the faith, was
engrossing the imagination of Europe. The subsequent influence of
the legend was doubtless to some extent associated with the
discussions which continually came up anew respecting the meaning
of the doctrine of the Eucharist; for it was not until the Council
of Trent (1545-63) that the doctrine was finally and
authoritatively defined. In the mean time there was interminable
discussion respecting the nature of this "real presence,"
respecting <i>tran</i>substantiation and <i>con</i>substantiation
and impanation, respecting the actual presence of the body and
blood of Christ under the <i>appearance</i> of the bread and wine,
or the presence of the body and blood <i>together with</i> the
bread and wine. The professor of philosophy in the University of
Oxford, who passes daily through Logic Lane, has said that there
the followers of Duns Scotus and Thomas Aquinas were wont to come
to blows in the eagerness of their discussion respecting the proper
definition of the doctrine. Nor was the doctrine without interest
to the Reformers. Luther and Zwingli held opposing views, and
Calvin was involved in a long dispute concerning the doctrine,
which resulted in the division of the evangelical body into the two
parties of the Lutherans and the Reformed. Doubtless the connection
between the Arthurian legend and the doctrine of the Divine
Presence was not without influence on the unparalleled spread of
the legend in the closing decades of the twelfth century, and on
its prominence in the centuries following.</p>
<p>A suggestion has already been given of the vast development of
the Arthurian legends during the thirteenth, fourteenth, and
fifteenth centuries, and of the importance of the labors of the
specialists, who are endeavoring to fix a date for these versions
in order to infer therefrom the spiritual ideals of the people
among whom they arose. To perceive clearly to what extent ideals do
change, it is but necessary to compare various versions of the same
incident as given in various periods of time. To go no farther back
than Malory, for example, we observe a signal difference between
his treatment of the sin of Guinevere and Launcelot, and the
treatment of the theme by Tennyson. Malory's Arthur is not so much
wounded by the treachery of Launcelot, of whose relations to
Guinevere he had long been aware, as he is angered at Sir Modred
for making public those disclosures which made it necessary for him
and Sir Launcelot to "bee at debate." "Ah! Agravaine, Agravaine,"
cries the King, "Jesu forgive it thy soule! for thine evill will
that thou and thy brother Sir Modred had unto Sir Launcelot hath
caused all this sorrow.... Wit you well my heart was never so
heavie as it is now, and much more I am sorrier for my good knights
losse than for the losse of my queene, for queenes might I have
enough, but such a fellowship of good knightes shall never bee
together in no company." But to the great Poet Laureate, who voices
the modern ideal, a true marriage is the crown of life. To love one
maiden only, to cleave to her and worship her by years of noblest
deeds, to be joined with her and to live together as one life, and,
reigning with one will in all things, to have power on this dead
world to make it live,--this was the high ideal of the blameless
King.</p>
<blockquote>"Too wholly true to dream untruth in
thee."</blockquote>
<p>And his farewell from her who had not made his life so sweet
that he should greatly care to live,--</p>
<blockquote>"Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God<br>
Forgives: ...<br>
And so thou lean on our fair father Christ,<br>
Hereafter in that world where all are pure<br>
We two may meet before high God, and thou<br>
Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine,"--</blockquote>
<p>this is altogether one of the noblest passages in modern
verse.</p>
<p>A comparison of the various modern treatments of the Tristram
theme, as given by Tennyson, Richard Wagner, F. Roeber, L.
Schneegans, Matthew Arnold, Algernon Charles Swinburne, F. Millard,
touching also on the Tristan of Hans Sachs, and the Tristram who,
because he is true to love, is the darling of the old romances, and
is there--notwithstanding that his love is the wedded wife of
another--always represented as the strong and beautiful knight, the
flower of courtesy, a model to youth,--such a comparison would
reveal striking differences between medi&aelig;val and modern
ideals.</p>
<p>In making the comparison, however, care must be exercised to
select the modern treatment of the theme which represents correctly
the modern ideal. The Middle Age romances, sung by wandering
minstrels, before the invention of the printing press, doubtless
expressed the ideals of the age in which they were produced more
infallibly than does the possibly individualistic conception of the
modern poet; for, of the earlier forms of the romance, only those
which found general favor were likely to be preserved and handed
down. This inference may be safely made because of the method of
the dissemination of the poems before the art of printing was
known. It is true that copies of them were carried in manuscript
from country to country; but the more important means of
dissemination were the minstrels, who passed from court to court
and land to land, singing the songs which they had made or heard.
In that age there was little thought of literary proprietorship.
The poem belonged to him who could recall it. And as each minstrel
felt free to adopt whatever poem he found or heard that pleased
him, so he felt free also to modify the incidents thereof, guided
only by his experience as to what pleased his hearers. Hence the
countless variations in the treatment of the theme, and the value
of the conclusions that may be drawn as to the moral sentiment of
an age, the quality of whose moral judgments is indicated by the
prevailing tone of the songs which persisted because they pleased.
Unconformable variations, which express the view of an individual
rather than the view of a people, may have come down to us in an
accidentally preserved manuscript; but the songs which were sung by
the poets of all lands give expression to the view of life of the
age, and reveal the morals and the ideals of nations, whose history
in this respect may otherwise be lost to us. What some of these
ideals were, as revealed by this rich store of poetic material
which grew up about the chivalrous and spiritual ideals of the
Middle Ages, and what the corresponding modern ideals are,--what,
in brief, some of the hitherto dimly discerned ethical movements of
the past seven hundred years have in reality been, and whither they
seem to be tending,--surely, clear knowledge on these themes is an
end worthy the supreme endeavor of finished scholars, whose
training has made them expert in interpreting the aspirations of
each age, and in tracing the evolution of the ideals of the past
into the realities of the present. And though, as M. Gaston Paris
has said, the path of the Arthurian scholar seems at times to be an
inextricable maze, yet the value of the results already achieved,
and the possibility of still greater results, will doubtless prove
a sufficient encouragement to the several generations of scholars
which, as Dr. Sommer suggests, are needed for the gigantic
task.</p>

OF MONMOUTH'S 'HISTORIA BRITONUM'</h2>
<h3>ARTHUR SUCCEEDS UTHER, HIS FATHER, IN THE KINGDOM OF BRITAIN,
AND BESIEGES COLGRIN</h3>
<br>
<p>Uther Pendragon being dead, the nobility from several provinces
assembled together at Silchester, and proposed to Dubricius,
Archbishop of Legions, that he should consecrate Arthur, Uther's
son, to be their king. For they were now in great straits, because,
upon hearing of the king's death, the Saxons had invited over their
countrymen from Germany, and were attempting, under the command of
Colgrin, to exterminate the whole British race.... Dubricius,
therefore, grieving for the calamities of his country, in
conjunction with the other bishops set the crown upon Arthur's
head. Arthur was then only fifteen years old, but a youth of such
unparalleled courage and generosity, joined with that sweetness of
temper and innate goodness, as gained for him universal love. When
his coronation was over, he, according to usual custom, showed his
bounty and munificence to the people. And such a number of soldiers
flocked to him upon it that his treasury was not able to answer
that vast expense. But such a spirit of generosity, joined with
valor, can never long want means to support itself. Arthur,
therefore, the better to keep up his munificence, resolved to make
use of his courage, and to fall upon the Saxons, that he might
enrich his followers with their wealth. To this he was also moved
by the justice of the cause, since the entire monarchy of Britain
belonged to him by hereditary right. Hereupon assembling the youth
under his command, he marched to York, of which, when Colgrin had
intelligence, he met with a very great army, composed of Saxons,
Scots, and Picts, by the river Duglas, where a battle happened,
with the loss of the greater part of both armies. Notwithstanding,
the victory fell to Arthur, who pursued Colgrin to York, and there
besieged him.</p>
<br>
<h3>DUBRICIUS'S SPEECH AGAINST THE TREACHEROUS SAXONS, OF WHOM
ARTHUR SLAYS MANY IN BATTLE</h3>
<br>
<p>When he had done speaking, St. Dubricius, Archbishop of Legions,
going to the top of a hill, cried out with a loud voice, "You that
have the honor to profess the Christian faith, keep fixed in your
minds the love which you owe to your country and fellow subjects,
whose sufferings by the treachery of the Pagans will be an
everlasting reproach to you if you do not courageously defend them.
It is your country which you fight for, and for which you should,
when required, voluntarily suffer death; for that itself is victory
and the cure of the soul. For he that shall die for his brethren,
offers himself a living sacrifice to God, and has Christ for his
example, who condescended to lay down his life for his brethren.
If, therefore, any of you shall be killed in this war, that death
itself, which is suffered in so glorious a cause, shall be to him
for penance and absolution of all his sins." At these words, all of
them, encouraged with the benediction of the holy prelate,
instantly armed themselves.... Upon [Arthur's shield] the picture
of the blessed Mary, Mother of God, was painted, in order to put
him frequently in mind of her.... In this manner was a great part
of that day also spent; whereupon Arthur, provoked to see the
little advantage he had yet gained, and that victory still
continued in suspense, drew out his Caliburn [Excalibur, Tennyson],
and calling upon the name of the blessed Virgin, rushed forward
with great fury into the thickest of the enemy's ranks; of whom
(such was the merit of his prayers) not one escaped alive that felt
the fury of his sword; neither did he give over the fury of his
assault until he had, with his Caliburn alone, killed four hundred
and seventy men. The Britons, seeing this, followed their leader in
great multitudes, and made slaughter on all sides; so that Colgrin
and Baldulph, his brother, and many thousands more, fell before
them. But Cheldric, in his imminent danger of his men, betook
himself to flight.</p>
<br>
<h3>ARTHUR INCREASES HIS DOMINIONS</h3>
<p>After this, having invited over to him all persons whatsoever
that were famous for valor in foreign nations, he began to augment
the number of his domestics, and introduced such politeness into
his court as people of the remotest countries thought worthy of
their imitation. So that there was not a nobleman who thought
himself of any consideration unless his clothes and arms were made
in the same fashion as those of Arthur's knights. At length the
fame of his munificence and valor spreading over the whole world,
he became a terror to the kings of other countries, who grievously
feared the loss of their dominions if he should make any attempt
upon them.... Arthur formed a design for the conquest of all
Europe.... At the end of nine years, in which time all the parts of
Gaul were entirely reduced, Arthur returned back to Paris, where he
kept his court, and calling an assembly of the clergy and people,
established peace and the just administration of the laws in that
kingdom. Then he bestowed Neustria, now called Normandy, upon
Bedoer, his butler; the province of Andegavia upon Caius, his
sewer; and several other provinces upon his great men that attended
him. Thus, having settled the peace of the cities and the countries
there, he returned back in the beginning of spring to Britain.</p>
<br>
<h3>ARTHUR HOLDS A SOLEMN FESTIVAL</h3>
<p>Upon the approach of the feast of Pentecost, Arthur, the better
to demonstrate his joy after such triumphant success, and for the
more solemn observation of that festival, and reconciling the minds
of the princes that were now subject to him, resolved, during that
season, to hold a magnificent court, to place the crown upon his
head, and to invite all the kings and dukes under his subjection to
the solemnity. And when he had communicated his design to his
familiar friends, he pitched upon the city of Legions as a proper
place for his purpose. For besides its great wealth above the other
cities, its situation, which was in Glamorganshire, upon the River
Uske, near the Severn Sea, was most pleasant and fit for so great a
solemnity; for on one side it was washed by that noble river, so
that the kings and princes from the countries beyond the seas might
have the convenience of sailing up to it. On the other side, the
beauty of the meadows and groves, and magnificence of the royal
palaces, with lofty, gilded roofs that adorned it, made it even
rival the grandeur of Rome. It was also famous for two churches:
whereof one was built in honor of the martyr Julius, and adorned
with a choir of virgins, who had devoted themselves wholly to the
service of God; but the other, which was founded in memory of St.
Aaron, his companion, and maintained a convent of canons, was the
third metropolitan church of Britain. Besides, there was a college
of two hundred philosophers, who, being learned in astronomy and
the other arts, were diligent in observing the courses of the
stars, and gave Arthur true predictions of the events that would
happen at that time. In this place, therefore, which afforded such
delights, were preparations made for the ensuing festival.
Ambassadors were sent into several kingdoms to invite to court the
princes both of Gaul and all the adjacent islands ... who came with
such a train of mules, horses, and rich furniture as it is
difficult to describe. Besides these, there remained no prince of
any consideration on this side of Spain, who came not upon this
invitation. And no wonder, when Arthur's munificence, which was
celebrated over the whole world, made him beloved by all
people.</p>
<p>When all these were assembled together in the city, upon the day
of the solemnity, the archbishops were conducted to the palace, in
order to place the crown upon the king's head. Therefore Dubricius,
inasmuch as the court was kept in his diocese, made himself ready
to celebrate the office, and undertook the ordering of whatever
related to it. As soon as the king was invested with his royal
habiliments, he was conducted in great pomp to the metropolitan
church, supported on each side by two archbishops, and having four
kings, viz., of Albania, Cornwall, Demetia, and Venedotia, whose
right it was, bearing four golden swords before him. He was also
attended with a concert of all sorts of music, which made most
excellent harmony. On another part was the queen, dressed out in
her richest ornaments, conducted by the archbishops and bishops to
the Temple of Virgins; the four queens also of the kings last
mentioned, bearing before her four white doves, according to
ancient custom; and after her there followed a retinue of women,
making all imaginable demonstrations of joy. When the whole
procession was ended, so transporting was the harmony of the
musical instruments and voices, whereof there was a vast variety in
both churches, that the knights who attended were in doubt which to
prefer, and therefore crowded from the one to the other by turns,
and were far from being tired with the solemnity, though the whole
day had been spent in it. At last, when divine service was over at
both churches, the king and queen put off their crowns, and putting
on their lighter ornaments, went to the banquet, he to one palace
with the men, she to another with the women. For the Britons still
observed the ancient custom of Troy, by which the men and women
used to celebrate their festivals apart. When they had all taken
their seats according to precedence, Caius, the sewer, in rich
robes of ermine, with a thousand young noblemen, all in like manner
clothed with ermine, served up the dishes. From another part,
Bedoer, the butler, was followed with the same number of
attendants, in various habits, who waited with all kinds of cups
and drinking vessels. In the queen's palace were innumerable
waiters, dressed with variety of ornaments, all performing their
respective offices; which, if I should describe particularly, I
should draw out the history to a tedious length. For at that time
Britain had arrived at such a pitch of grandeur, that in abundance
of riches, luxury of ornaments, and politeness of inhabitants, it
far surpassed all other kingdoms. The knights in it that were
famous for feats of chivalry wore their clothes and arms all of the
same color and fashion: and the women also, no less celebrated for
their wit, wore all the same kind of apparel; and esteemed none
worthy of their love but such as had given a proof of their valor
in three several battles. Thus was the valor of the men an
encouragement for the women's chastity, and the love of the women a
spur to the soldiers' bravery.</p>
<br>
<h3>AFTER A VARIETY OF SPORTS AT THE CORONATION, ARTHUR AMPLY
REWARDS HIS SERVANTS</h3>
<p>As soon as the banquets were over they went into the fields
without the city to divert themselves with various sports. The
military men composed a kind of diversion in imitation of a fight
on horseback; and the ladies, placed on the top of the walls as
spectators, in a sportive manner darted their amorous glances at
the courtiers, the more to encourage them. Others spent the
remainder of the day in other diversions, such as shooting with
bows and arrows, tossing the pike, casting of heavy stones and
rocks, playing at dice and the like, and all these inoffensively
and without quarreling. Whoever gained the victory in any of these
sports was awarded with a rich prize by Arthur. In this manner were
the first three days spent; and on the fourth, all who, upon
account of their titles, bore any kind of office at this solemnity,
were called together to receive honors and preferments in reward of
their services, and to fill up the vacancies in the governments of
cities and castles, archbishoprics, bishoprics, abbeys, and other
hosts of honor.</p>
<br>
<h3>ARTHUR COMMITS TO HIS NEPHEW MODRED THE GOVERNMENT OF BRITAIN,
AND ENGAGES IN A WAR WITH ROME</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the following summer, as he was on his march
toward Rome and was beginning to pass the Alps, he had news brought
him that his nephew Modred, to whose care he had intrusted Britain,
had, by tyrannical and treasonable practices, set the crown upon
his own head. [Book xi., Chapters i. and ii.] His [Modred's] whole
army, taking Pagans and Christians together, amounted to eighty
thousand men, with the help of whom he met Arthur just after his
landing at the port of Rutupi, and joining battle with him, made a
very great slaughter of his men.... After they had at last, with
much difficulty, got ashore, they paid back the slaughter, and put
Modred and his army to flight. For by long practice in war they had
learned an excellent way of ordering their forces; which was so
managed that while their foot were employed either in an assault or
upon the defensive, the horse would come in at full speed
obliquely, break through the enemy's ranks, and so force them to
flee. Nevertheless, this perjured usurper got his forces together
again, and the night following entered Winchester. As soon as Queen
Guanhumara [Guinevere] heard this, she immediately, despairing of
success, fled from York to the City of Legions, where she resolved
to lead a chaste life among the nuns in the church of Julius the
Martyr, and entered herself one of their order....</p>
<p>In the battle that followed thereupon, great numbers lost their
lives on both sides.... In this assault fell the wicked traitor
himself, and many thousands with him. But notwithstanding the loss
of him, the rest did not flee, but running together from all parts
of the field, maintained their ground with undaunted courage. The
fight now grew more furious than ever, and proved fatal to almost
all the commanders and their forces.... And even the renowned King
Arthur himself was mortally wounded; and being carried thence to
the isle of Avallon to be cured of his wounds, he gave up the crown
of Britain to his kinsman Constantine, the son of Cador, Duke of
Cornwall, in the five hundred and forty-second year of our Lord's
incarnation.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="THE_HOLY_GRAIL"></a>THE HOLY GRAIL</h2>
<center>From Malory's 'Morte d'Arthur'</center>
<br>
<p>"Faire knight," said the King, "what is your name? I require you
of your knighthood to tell me."</p>
<p>"Sir," said Sir Launcelot, "wit ye well, my name is Sir
Launcelot du Lake."</p>
<p>"And my name is Sir Pelles, king of the forrain countrey, and
nigh cousin unto Joseph of Arithmy" [Arimathea].</p>
<p>Then either of them made much of the other, and so they went
into the castle for to take their repast. And anon there came in a
dove at the window, and in her bill there seemed a little censer of
gold, and therewithal there was such a savor as though all the
spicery of the world had been there; and forthwithal there was upon
the table all manner of meates and drinkes that they could thinke
upon. So there came a damosell, passing faire and young, and she
beare a vessell of gold between her hands, and thereto the king
kneeled devoutly and said his prayers, and so did all that were
there.</p>
<p>"O Jesu," said Sir Launcelot, "what may this meane?"</p>
<p>"This is," said King Pelles, "the richest thing that any man
hath living; and when this thing goeth about, the round table shall
bee broken. And wit ye well," said King Pelles, "that this is the
holy sanegreall which ye have heere seene."</p>
<p>So King Pelles and Sir Launcelot led their lives the most part
of that day.</p>

<p>sbj&ouml;rnsen was born January 15th, 1812, at Christiania,
Norway. He entered the University in 1833, but was presently
obliged to take the position of tutor with a family in Romerike.
Four years later he came back to the University, where he studied
medicine, but also and particularly zo&ouml;logy and botany,
subjects which he subsequently taught in various schools. During
his life among the country people he had begun to collect
folk-tales and legends, and afterward, on long foot-tours
undertaken in the pursuit of his favorite studies, he added to this
store. In co-operation with his lifelong friend, J&ouml;rgen Moe,
subsequently Bishop of Christiansand, he published in 1838 a first
collection of folk-stories. In later years his study of folk-lore
went on side by side with his study of zo&ouml;logy. At various
times, from 1846 to 1853, he received stipends from the Christiania
University to enable him to pursue zo&ouml;logical investigations
at points along the Norwegian coast. In addition to these journeys
he had traversed Norway in every direction, partly to observe the
condition of the forests of the country, and partly to collect the
popular legends, which seem always to have been in his mind.</p>
<p>From 1856 to 1858 he studied forestry at Tharand, and in 1860
was made head forester of the district of Trondhjem, in the north
of Norway. He retained this position until 1864, when he was sent
by the government to Holland, Germany, and Denmark, to investigate
the turf industry. On his return he was made the head of a
commission whose purpose was to better the turf production of the
country, from which position he was finally released with a pension
in 1876. He died in 1885.</p>
<p>Asbj&ouml;rnsen's principal literary work was in the direction
of the folk-tales of Norway, although the list of his writings on
natural history, popular and scientific, is a long one. As a
scientist he made several important discoveries in deep-sea
soundings, which gave him, at home and abroad, a wide reputation,
but the significance of his work as a collector of folk-lore has in
a great measure overshadowed this phase of his activity. His
greatest works are--'Norske Folke-eventyr' (Norwegian Folk Tales),
in collaboration with Moe, which appeared in 1842-44, and
subsequently in many editions; 'Norske Huldre-eventyr og Folkesagn'
(Norwegian Fairy Tales and Folk Legends) in 1845. In the stories
published by Asbj&ouml;rnsen alone, he has not confined himself
simply to the reproduction of the tales in their popular form, but
has retold them with an admirable setting of the characteristics of
the life of the people in their particular environment. He was a
rare lover of nature, and there are many exquisite bits of natural
description.</p>
<p>Asbj&ouml;rnsen's literary power was of no mean merit, and his
work not only found immediate acceptance in his own country, but
has been widely translated into the other languages of Europe.
Norwegian literature in particular owes him a debt of gratitude,
for he was the first to point out the direction of the subsequent
national development.</p>

<p>There was once a man named Gudbrand, who had a farm which lay on
the side of a mountain, whence he was called Gudbrand of the
Mountain-side. He and his wife lived in such harmony together, and
were so well matched, that whatever the husband did, seemed to the
wife so well done that it could not be done better; let him
therefore act as he might, she was equally well pleased.</p>
<p>They owned a plot of ground, and had a hundred dollars lying at
the bottom of a chest, and in the stall two fine cows. One day the
woman said to Gudbrand:--</p>
<p>"I think we might as well drive one of the cows to town, and
sell it; we should then have a little pocket-money: for such
respectable persons as we are ought to have a few shillings in hand
as well as others. The hundred dollars at the bottom of the chest
we had better not touch; but I do not see why we should keep more
than one cow: besides, we shall be somewhat the gainers; for
instead of two cows, I shall have only one to milk and look
after."</p>
<p>These words Gudbrand thought both just and reasonable; so he
took the cow and went to the town in order to sell it: but when he
came there, he could not find any one who wanted to buy a cow.</p>
<p>"Well!" thought Gudbrand, "I can go home again with my cow: I
have both stall and collar for her, and it is no farther to go
backwards than forwards." So saying, he began wandering home
again.</p>
<p>When he had gone a little way, he met a man who had a horse he
wished to sell, and Gudbrand thought it better to have a horse than
a cow, so he exchanged with the man. Going a little further still,
he met a man driving a fat pig before him; and thinking it better
to have a fat pig than a horse, he made an exchange with him also.
A little further on he met a man with a goat. "A goat," thought he,
"is always better to have than a pig;" so he made an exchange with
the owner of the goat. He now walked on for an hour, when he met a
man with a sheep; with him he exchanged his goat: "for," thought
he, "it is always better to have a sheep than a goat." After
walking some way again, meeting a man with a goose, he changed away
the sheep for the goose; then going on a long way, he met a man
with a cock, and thought to himself, "It is better to have a cock
than a goose," and so gave his goose for the cock. Having walked on
till the day was far gone, and beginning to feel hungry, he sold
the cock for twelve shillings, and bought some food; "for," thought
he, "it is better to support life than to carry back the cock."
After this he continued his way homeward till he reached the house
of his nearest neighbor, where he called in.</p>
<p>"How have matters gone with you in town?" asked the
neighbor.</p>
<p>"Oh," answered Gudbrand, "but so-so; I cannot boast of my luck,
neither can I exactly complain of it." He then began to relate all
that he had done from first to last.</p>
<p>"You'll meet with a warm reception when you get home to your
wife," said his neighbor. "God help you, I would not be in your
place."</p>
<p>"I think things might have been much worse," said Gudbrand; "but
whether they are good or bad, I have such a gentle wife that she
will never say a word, let me do what I may."</p>
<p>"Yes, that I know," answered his neighbor; "but I do not think
she will be so gentle in this instance."</p>
<p>"Shall we lay a wager?" said Gudbrand of the Mountain-side. "I
have got a hundred dollars in my chest at home; will you venture
the like sum?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will," replied the neighbor, and they wagered
accordingly, and remained till evening drew on, when they set out
together for Gudbrand's house; having agreed that the neighbor
should stand outside and listen, while Gudbrand went in to meet his
wife.</p>
<p>"Good-evening," said Gudbrand.</p>
<p>"Good-evening," said his wife, "thank God thou art there."</p>
<p>Yes, there he was. His wife then began asking him how he had
fared in the town.</p>
<p>"So-so," said Gudbrand: "I have not much to boast of; for when I
reached the town there was no one who would buy the cow, so I
changed it for a horse."</p>
<p>"Many thanks for that," said his wife: "we are such respectable
people that we ought to ride to church as well as others; and if we
can afford to keep a horse, we may certainly have one. Go and put
the horse in the stable, children."</p>
<p>"Oh," said Gudbrand, "but I have not got the horse; for as I
went along the road, I exchanged the horse for a pig."</p>
<p>"Well," said the woman, "that is just what I should have done
myself; I thank thee for that. I can now have pork and bacon in my
house to offer anybody when they come to see us. What should we
have done with a horse? People would only have said we were grown
too proud to walk to church. Go, children, and put the pig in."</p>
<p>"But I have not brought the pig with me," exclaimed Gudbrand;
"for when I had gone a little further on, I exchanged it for a
milch goat."</p>
<p>"How admirably thou dost everything," exclaimed his wife. "What
should we have done with a pig? People would only have said that we
eat everything we own. Yes, now that I have a goat, I can get both
milk and cheese, and still keep my goat. Go and tie the goat,
children."</p>
<p>"No," said Gudbrand, "I have not brought home the goat; for when
I came a little further on, I changed the goat for a fine
sheep."</p>
<p>"Well," cried the woman, "thou hast done everything just as I
could wish; just as if I had been there myself. What should we have
done with a goat? I must have climbed up the mountains and wandered
through the valleys to bring it home in the evening. With a sheep I
should have wool and clothing in the house, with food into the
bargain. So go, children, and put the sheep into the field."</p>
<p>"But I have not got the sheep," said Gudbrand, "for as I went a
little further, I changed it away for a goose."</p>
<p>"Many, many thanks for that," said his wife. "What should I have
done with a sheep? For I have neither a spinning-wheel nor have I
much desire to toil and labor to make clothes; we can purchase
clothing as we have hitherto: now I shall have roast goose, which I
have often longed for; and then I can make a little pillow of the
feathers. Go and bring in the goose, children."</p>
<p>"But I have not got the goose," said Gudbrand; "as I came on a
little further, I changed it away for a cock."</p>
<p>"Heaven only knows how thou couldst think of all this,"
exclaimed his wife, "it is just as if I had managed it all myself.
A cock! that is just as good as if thou hadst bought an eight-day
clock; for as the cock crows every morning at four o'clock, we can
be stirring betimes. What should I have done with a goose? I do not
know how to dress a goose, and my pillow I can stuff with moss. Go
and fetch in the cock, children."</p>
<p>"But I have not brought the cock home with me," said Gudbrand;
"for when I had gone a long, long way, I became so hungry that I
was obliged to sell the cock for twelve shillings to keep me
alive."</p>
<p>"Well! thank God thou always dost just as I could wish to have
it done. What should we have done with a cock? We are our own
masters; we can lie as long as we like in the morning. God be
praised, I have got thee here safe again, and as thou always dost
everything so right, we want neither a cock, nor a goose, nor a
pig, nor a sheep, nor a cow."</p>
<p>Hereupon Gudbrand opened the door:--"Have I won your hundred
dollars?" asked he of the neighbor, who was obliged to confess that
he had.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_WIDOW'S_SON"></a>THE WIDOW'S SON</h2>
<p>There was once a very poor woman who had only one son. She
toiled for him till he was old enough to be confirmed by the
priest, when she told him that she could support him no longer, but
that he must go out in the world and gain his own livelihood. So
the youth set out, and after wandering about for a day or two he
met a stranger. "Whither art thou going?" asked the man. "I am
going out in the world to see if I can get employment," answered
the youth.--"Wilt thou serve us?"--"Yes, just as well serve you as
anybody else," answered the youth. "Thou shalt be well cared for
with me," said the man: "thou shalt be my companion, and do little
or nothing besides."</p>
<p>So the youth resided with him, had plenty to eat and drink, and
very little or nothing to do; but he never saw a living person in
the man's house.</p>
<p>One day his master said to him:--"I am going to travel, and
shall be absent eight days. During that time thou wilt be here
alone: but thou must not go into either of these four rooms; if
thou dost, I will kill thee when I return." The youth answered that
he would not. When the man had gone away three or four days, the
youth could no longer refrain, but went into one of the rooms. He
looked around, but saw nothing except a shelf over the door, with a
whip made of briar on it. "This was well worth forbidding me so
strictly from seeing," thought the youth. When the eight days had
passed the man came home again. "Thou hast not, I hope, been into
any of my rooms," said he. "No, I have not," answered the youth.
"That I shall soon be able to see," said the man, going into the
room the youth had entered. "But thou hast been in," said he, "and
now thou shalt die." The youth cried and entreated to be forgiven,
so that he escaped with his life but had a severe beating; when
that was over, they were as good friends as before.</p>
<p>Some time after this, the man took another journey. This time he
would be away a fortnight, but first forbade the youth again from
going into any of the rooms he had not already been in; but the one
he had previously entered he might enter again. This time all took
place just as before, the only difference being that the youth
abstained for eight days before he entered the forbidden rooms. In
one apartment he found only a shelf over the door, on which lay a
huge stone and a water-bottle. "This is also something to be in
such fear about," thought the youth again. When the man came home,
he asked whether he had been in any of the rooms. "No, he had not,"
was the answer. "I shall soon see," said the man; and when he found
that the youth had nevertheless been in, he said, "Now I will no
longer spare thee, thou shalt die." But the youth cried and
implored that his life might be spared, and thus again escaped with
a beating; but this time got as much as could be laid on him. When
he had recovered from the effect of this beating he lived as well
as ever, and he and the man were as good friends as before.</p>
<p>Some time after this, the man again made a journey, and now he
was to be three weeks absent. He warned the youth anew not to enter
the third room; if he did he must at once prepare to die. At the
end of a fortnight, the youth had no longer any command over
himself, and stole in; but here he saw nothing save a trap-door in
the floor. He lifted it up and looked through; there stood a large
copper kettle, that boiled and boiled, yet he could see no fire
under it. "I should like to know if it is hot," thought the youth,
dipping his finger down into it; but when he drew it up again he
found that all his finger was gilt. He scraped and washed it, but
the gilding was not to be removed; so he tied a rag over it, and
when the man returned and asked him what was the matter with his
finger, he answered he had cut it badly. But the man, tearing the
rag off, at once saw what ailed the finger. At first he was going
to kill the youth, but as he cried and begged again, he merely beat
him so that he was obliged to lie in bed for three days. The man
then took a pot down from the wall and rubbed him with what it
contained, so that the youth was as well as before.</p>
<p>After some time the man made another journey, and said he should
not return for a month. He then told the youth that if he went into
the fourth room, he must not think for a moment that his life would
be spared. One, two, even three weeks the youth refrained from
entering the forbidden room; but then, having no longer any command
over himself, he stole in. There stood a large black horse in a
stall, with a trough of burning embers at its head and a basket of
hay at its tail. The youth thought this was cruel, and therefore
changed their position, putting the basket of hay by the horse's
head. The horse thereupon said:--</p>
<p>"As you have so kind a disposition that you enable me to get
food, I will save you: should the Troll return and find you here,
he will kill you. Now you must go up into the chamber above this,
and take one of the suits of armor that hang there: but on no
account take one that is bright; on the contrary, select the most
rusty you can see, and take that; choose also a sword and saddle in
like manner."</p>
<p>The youth did so, but he found the whole very heavy for him to
carry. When he came back, the horse said that now he should strip
and wash himself well in the kettle, which stood boiling in the
next apartment. "I feel afraid," thought the youth, but
nevertheless did so. When he had washed himself, he became comely
and plump, and as red and white as milk and blood, and much
stronger than before. "Are you sensible of any change?" asked the
horse. "Yes," answered the youth. "Try to lift me," said the horse.
Aye, that he could, and brandished the sword with ease. "Now lay
the saddle on me," said the horse, "put on the armor and take the
whip of thorn, the stone and the water-flask, and the pot with
ointment, and then we will set out."</p>
<p>When the youth had mounted the horse, it started off at a rapid
rate. After riding some time, the horse said, "I think I hear a
noise. Look round: can you see anything?" "A great many men are
coming after us,--certainly a score at least," answered the youth.
"Ah! that is the Troll," said the horse, "he is coming with all his
companions."</p>
<p>They traveled for a time, until their pursuers were gaining on
them. "Throw now the thorn whip over your shoulder," said the
horse, "but throw it far away from me."</p>
<p>The youth did so, and at the same moment there sprang up a large
thick wood of briars. The youth now rode on a long way, while the
Troll was obliged to go home for something wherewith to hew a road
through the wood. After some time the horse again said, "Look back:
can you see anything now?" "Yes, a whole multitude of people," said
the youth, "like a church congregation."--"That is the Troll; now
he has got more with him; throw out now the large stone, but throw
it far from me."</p>
<p>When the youth had done what the horse desired, there arose a
large stone mountain behind them. So the Troll was obliged to go
home after something with which to bore through the mountain; and
while he was thus employed, the youth rode on a considerable way.
But now the horse again bade him look back: he then saw a multitude
like a whole army; they were so bright that they glittered in the
sun. "Well, that is the Troll with all his friends," said the
horse. "Now throw the water bottle behind you, but take good care
to spill nothing on me!" The youth did so, but notwithstanding his
caution he happened to spill a drop on the horse's loins.
Immediately there rose a vast lake, and the spilling of the few
drops caused the horse to stand far out in the water; nevertheless,
he at last swam to the shore.</p>
<p>When the Trolls came to the water they lay down to drink it all
up, and they gulped and gulped till they burst. "Now we are quit of
them," said the horse.</p>
<p>When they had traveled on a very long way they came to a green
plain in a wood. "Take off your armor now," said the horse, "and
put on your rags only; lift my saddle off and hang everything up in
that large hollow linden; make yourself then a wig of pine-moss, go
to the royal palace which lies close by, and there ask for
employment. When you desire to see me, come to this spot, shake the
bridle, and I will instantly be with you."</p>
<p>The youth did as the horse told him; and when he put on the moss
wig he became so pale and miserable to look at that no one would
have recognized him. On reaching the palace, he only asked if he
might serve in the kitchen to carry wood and water to the cook; but
the cook-maid asked him why he wore such an ugly wig? "Take it
off," said she: "I will not have anybody here so frightful." "That
I cannot," answered the youth, "for I am not very clean in the
head." "Dost thou think then that I will have thee in the kitchen,
if such be the case?" said she; "go to the master of the horse:
thou art fittest to carry muck from the stables." When the master
of the horse told him to take off his wig, he got the same answer,
so he refused to have him. "Thou canst go to the gardener," said
he, "thou art only fit to go and dig the ground." The gardener
allowed him to remain, but none of the servants would sleep with
him, so he was obliged to sleep alone under the stairs of the
summer-house, which stood upon pillars and had a high staircase,
under which he laid a quantity of moss for a bed, and there lay as
well as he could.</p>
<p>When he had been some time in the royal palace, it happened one
morning, just at sunrise, that the youth had taken off his moss wig
and was standing washing himself, and appeared so handsome it was a
pleasure to look on him. The princess saw from her window this
comely gardener, and thought she had never before seen any one so
handsome.</p>
<p>She then asked the gardener why he lay out there under the
stairs. "Because none of the other servants will lie with him,"
answered the gardener. "Let him come this evening and lie by the
door in my room," said the princess: "they cannot refuse after that
to let him sleep in the house."</p>
<p>The gardener told this to the youth. "Dost thou think I will do
so?" said he. "If I do so, all will say there is something between
me and the princess." "Thou hast reason, forsooth, to fear such a
suspicion," replied the gardener, "such a fine, comely lad as thou
art." "Well, if she has commanded it, I suppose I must comply,"
said the youth. In going up-stairs that evening he stamped and made
such a noise that they were obliged to beg of him to go more
gently, lest it might come to the king's knowledge. When within the
chamber, he lay down and began immediately to snore. The princess
then said to her waiting-maid, "Go gently and pull off his moss
wig." Creeping softly toward him, she was about to snatch it, but
he held it fast with both hands, and said she should not have it.
He then lay down again and began to snore. The princess made a sign
to the maid, and this time she snatched his wig off. There he lay
so beautifully red and white, just as the princess had seen him in
the morning sun. After this the youth slept every night in the
princess's chamber.</p>
<p>But it was not long before the king heard that the garden lad
slept every night in the princess's chamber, at which he became so
angry that he almost resolved on putting him to death. This,
however, he did not do, but cast him into prison, and his daughter
he confined to her room, not allowing her to go out, either by day
or night. Her tears and prayers for herself and the youth were
unheeded by the king, who only became the more incensed against
her.</p>
<p>Some time after this, there arose a war and disturbance in the
country, and the king was obliged to take arms and defend himself
against another king, who threatened to deprive him of his throne.
When the youth heard this he begged the jailer would go to the king
for him, and propose to let him have armor and a sword, and allow
him to follow to the war. All the courtiers laughed when the jailer
made known his errand to the king. They begged he might have some
old trumpery for armor, that they might enjoy the sport of seeing
the poor creature in the war. He got the armor and also an old jade
of a horse, which limped on three legs, dragging the fourth after
it.</p>
<p>Thus they all marched forth against the enemy, but they had not
gone far from the royal palace before the youth stuck fast with his
old jade in a swamp. Here he sat beating and calling to the jade,
"Hie! wilt thou go? hie! wilt thou go?" This amused all the others,
who laughed and jeered as they passed. But no sooner were they all
gone than, running to the linden, he put on his own armor and shook
the bridle, and immediately the horse appeared, and said, "Do thou
do thy best and I will do mine."</p>
<p>When the youth arrived on the field the battle had already
begun, and the king was hard pressed; but just at that moment the
youth put the enemy to flight. The king and his attendants wondered
who it could be that came to their help; but no one had been near
enough to speak to him, and when the battle was over he was away.
When they returned, the youth was still sitting fast in the swamp,
beating and calling to his three-legged jade. They laughed as they
passed, and said, "Only look, yonder sits the fool yet."</p>
<p>The next day when they marched out the youth was still sitting
there, and they again laughed and jeered at him; but no sooner had
they all passed by than he ran again to the linden, and everything
took place as on the previous day. Every one wondered who the
stranger warrior was who had fought for them; but no one approached
him so near that he could speak to him: of course no one ever
imagined that it was the youth.</p>
<p>When they returned in the evening and saw him and his old jade
still sticking fast in the swamp, they again made a jest of him;
one shot an arrow at him and wounded him in the leg, and he began
to cry and moan so that it was sad to hear, whereupon the king
threw him his handkerchief that he might bind it about his leg.
When they marched forth the third morning there sat the youth
calling to his horse, "Hie! wilt thou go? hie! wilt thou go?" "No,
no! he will stay there till he starves," said the king's men as
they passed by, and laughed so heartily at him that they nearly
fell from their horses. When they had all passed, he again ran to
the linden, and came to the battle just at the right moment. That
day he killed the enemy's king, and thus the war was at an end.</p>
<p>When the fighting was over, the king observed his handkerchief
tied round the leg of the strange warrior, and by this he easily
knew him. They received him with great joy, and carried him with
them up to the royal palace, and the princess, who saw them from
her window, was so delighted no one could tell. "There comes my
beloved also," said she. He then took the pot of ointment and
rubbed his leg, and afterward all the wounded, so that they were
all well again in a moment.</p>
<p>After this the king gave him the princess to wife. On the day of
his marriage he went down into the stable to see the horse, and
found him dull, hanging his ears and refusing to eat. When the
young king--for he was now king, having obtained the half of the
realm--spoke to him and asked him what he wanted, the horse said,
"I have now helped thee forward in the world, and I will live no
longer: thou must take thy sword, and cut my head off." "No, that I
will not do," said the young king: "thou shalt have whatever thou
wilt, and always live without working." "If thou wilt not do as I
say," answered the horse, "I shall find a way of killing thee."</p>
<p>The king was then obliged to slay him; but when he raised the
sword to give the stroke he was so distressed that he turned his
face away; but no sooner had he struck his head off than there
stood before him a handsome prince in the place of the horse.</p>
<p>"Whence in the name of Heaven didst thou come?" asked the king.
"It was I who was the horse," answered the prince. "Formerly I was
king of the country whose sovereign you slew yesterday; it was he
who cast over me a horse's semblance, and sold me to the Troll. As
he is killed, I shall recover my kingdom, and you and I shall be
neighboring kings; but we will never go to war with each
other."</p>
<p>Neither did they; they were friends as long as they lived, and
the one came often to visit the other.</p>

<p>his noted scholar owes his place in English literature to his
pure, vigorous English prose. John Tindal and Sir Thomas More, his
predecessors, had perhaps equaled him in the flexible and simple
use of his native tongue, but they had not surpassed him. The usage
of the time was still to write works of importance in Latin, and
Ascham was master of a good Ciceronian Latin style. It is to his
credit that he urged on his countrymen the writing of English, and
set them an example of its vigorous use.</p>
<p>He was the son of John Ascham, house steward to Lord Scrope of
Bolton, and was born at Kirby Wiske, near Northallerton, in 1515.
At the age of fifteen he entered St. John's College, Cambridge,
where he applied himself to Greek and Latin, mathematics, music,
and penmanship. He had great success in teaching and improving the
study of the classics; but seems to have had a somewhat checkered
academic career, both as student and teacher. His poverty was
excessive, and he made many unsuccessful attempts to secure
patronage and position; till at length, in 1545, he published his
famous treatise on Archery, 'Toxophilus,' which he presented to
Henry VIII. in the picture gallery at Greenwich, and which obtained
for him a small pension. The treatise is in the form of a dialogue,
the first part being an argument in favor of archery, and the
second, instructions for its practice. In its pages he makes a plea
for the literary use of the English tongue.</p>
<p>After long-continued disappointment and trouble, he was finally
successful in obtaining the position of tutor to the Princess
Elizabeth, in 1548. She was fifteen years old, and he found her an
apt scholar; but the life was irksome, and in 1550 he resigned the
post to return to Cambridge as public orator,--whence one may guess
as a main reason for so excellent a teacher having so hard a time
to live, that like many others he liked to talk about his
profession better than to practice it. Going abroad shortly
afterward as secretary to Sir Richard Morysin, ambassador to
Charles V., he remained with him until 1553, when he received the
appointment of Latin secretary to Queen Mary. It is said that he
wrote for her forty-seven letters in his fine Latin style, in three
days.</p>

<b>ROGER ASCHAM</b></p>
<p>At the accession of Elizabeth he received the office of the
Queen's private tutor. Poverty and "household griefs" still gave
him anxiety; but during the five years which elapsed between 1563
and his death in 1568, he found some comfort in the composition of
his Schoolmaster, which was published by his widow in 1570. It was
suggested by a conversation at Windsor with Sir William Cecil, on
the proper method of bringing up children. Sir Richard Sackville
was so well pleased with Ascham's theories that he, with others,
entreated him to write a practical work on the subject. 'The
Schoolmaster' argues in favor of gentleness rather than force on
the part of an instructor. Then he commends his own method of
teaching Latin by double translation, offers remarks on Latin
prosody, and touches on other pedagogic themes. Both this and the
'Toxophilus' show a pure, straightforward, easy style. Contemporary
testimony to its beauty may be found in an appendix to Mayor's
edition of 'The School master' (1863); though Dr. Johnson, in a
memoir prefixed to Rennet's collected edition of Ascham's English
works (1771), says that "he was scarcely known as an author in his
own language till Mr. Upton published his 'Schoolmaster' in 1771."
He has remained, however, the best known type of a great teacher in
the popular memory; in part, perhaps, through his great pupil.</p>
<p>The best collected edition of his works, including his Latin

EDUCATION</h2>
<center>From 'The Schoolmaster'</center>
<br>
<p>Yet some will say that children, of nature, love pastime, and
mislike learning; because, in their kind, the one is easy and
pleasant, the other hard and wearisome. Which is an opinion not so
true as some men ween. For the matter lieth not so much in the
disposition of them that be young, as in the order and manner of
bringing up by them that be old; nor yet in the difference of
learning and pastime. For, beat a child if he dance not well, and
cherish him though he learn not well, you shall have him unwilling
to go to dance, and glad to go to his book; knock him always when
he draweth his shaft ill, and favor him again though he fault at
his book, you shall have him very loth to be in the field, and very
willing to be in the school. Yea, I say more, and not of myself,
but by the judgment of those from whom few wise men will gladly
dissent; that if ever the nature of man be given at any time, more
than other, to receive goodness, it is in innocency of young years,
before that experience of evil have taken root in him. For the pure
clean wit of a sweet young babe is like the newest wax, most able
to receive the best and fairest printing; and like a new bright
silver dish never occupied, to receive and keep clean any good
thing that is put into it.</p>
<p>And thus, will in children, wisely wrought withal, may easily be
won to be very well willing to learn. And wit in children, by
nature, namely memory, the only key and keeper of all learning, is
readiest to receive and surest to keep any manner of thing that is
learned in youth. This, lewd and learned, by common experience,
know to be most true. For we remember nothing so well when we be
old as those things which we learned when we were young. And this
is not strange, but common in all nature's works. "Every man seeth
(as I said before) new wax is best for printing, new clay fittest
for working, new-shorn wool aptest for soon and surest dyeing, new
fresh flesh for good and durable salting." And this similitude is
not rude, nor borrowed of the larder-house, but out of his
school-house, of whom the wisest of England need not be ashamed to
learn. "Young grafts grow not only soonest, but also fairest, and
bring always forth the best and sweetest fruit; young whelps learn
easily to carry; young popin-jays learn quickly to speak." And so,
to be short, if in all other things, though they lack reason,
sense, and life, the similitude of youth is fittest to all
goodness, surely nature in mankind is most beneficial and effectual
in their behalf.</p>
<p>Therefore, if to the goodness of nature be joined the wisdom of
the teacher, in leading young wits into a right and plain way of
learning; surely children kept up in God's fear, and governed by
His grace, may most easily be brought well to serve God and their
country, both by virtue and wisdom.</p>
<p>But if will and wit, by farther age, be once allured from
innocency, delighted in vain sights, filled with foul talk, crooked
with wilfulness, hardened with stubbornness, and let loose to
disobedience; surely it is hard with gentleness, but impossible
with severe cruelty, to call them back to good frame again. For
where the one perchance may bend it, the other shall surely break
it: and so, instead of some hope, leave an assured desperation, and
shameless contempt of all goodness; the furthest point in all
mischief, as Xenophon doth most truly and most wittily mark.</p>
<p>Therefore, to love or to hate, to like or contemn, to ply this
way or that way to good or to bad, ye shall have as ye use a child
in his youth.</p>
<p>And one example whether love or fear doth work more in a child
for virtue and learning, I will gladly report; which may be heard
with some pleasure, and followed with more profit.</p>
<p>Before I went into Germany, I came to Broadgate in
Leicestershire, to take my leave of that noble lady, Jane Grey, to
whom I was exceeding much beholding. Her parents, the duke and
duchess, with all the household, gentlemen and gentlewomen, were
hunting in the park. I found her in her chamber, reading
Ph&aelig;do Platonis in Greek, and that with as much delight as
some gentlemen would read a merry tale in Boccace. After salutation
and duty done, with some other talk, I asked her why she would
leese [lose] such pastime in the park? Smiling she answered me:
"Iwisse, all their sport in the park is but a shadow to that
pleasure that I find in Plato. Alas! good folk, they never felt
what true pleasure meant." "And how came you, madame," quoth I, "to
this deep knowledge of pleasure? and what did chiefly allure you
unto it, seeing not many women, but very few men, have attained
thereunto?" "I will tell you," quoth she, "and tell you a truth,
which perchance ye will marvel at. One of the greatest benefits
that ever God gave me, is, that he sent me so sharp and severe
parents, and so gentle a schoolmaster. For when I am in presence
either of father or mother, whether I speak, keep silence, sit,
stand, or go, eat, drink, be merry, or sad, be sewing, playing,
dancing, or doing anything else, I must do it, as it were, in such
weight, measure, and number, even so perfectly, as God made the
world; or else I am so sharply taunted, so cruelly threatened, yea,
presently, sometimes with pinches, nips, and bobs, and other ways
which I will not name, for the honor I bear them, so without
measure misordered, that I think myself in hell, till time come
that I must go to Mr. Elmer; who teacheth me so gently, so
pleasantly, with such fair allurements to learning, that I think
all the time nothing whiles I am with him. And when I am called
from him, I fall on weeping, because whatsoever I do else but
learning, is full of grief, trouble, fear, and whole misliking unto
me. And thus my book hath been so much my pleasure, and bringeth
daily to me more pleasure and more, that in respect of it, all
other pleasures, in very deed, be but trifles and troubles unto
me."</p>
<p>I remember this talk gladly, both because it is so worthy of
memory, and because also it was the last talk that ever I had, and
the last time that ever I saw that noble and worthy lady.</p>

<h2><a name="ON_STUDY_AND_EXERCISE"></a>ON STUDY AND EXERCISE</h2>
<center>From 'Toxophilus'</center>
<br>
<p>Philologe--But now to our shooting, Toxophile, again; wherein I
suppose you cannot say so much for shooting to be fit for learning,
as you have spoken against music for the same. Therefore, as
concerning music, I can be content to grant you your mind; but as
for shooting, surely I suppose that you cannot persuade me, by no
means, that a man can be earnest in it, and earnest at his book
too; but rather I think that a man with a bow on his back, and
shafts under his girdle, is more fit to wait upon Robin Hood than
upon Apollo or the Muses.</p>
<p><i>Toxophile</i>--Over-earnest shooting surely I will not
over-earnestly defend; for I ever thought shooting should be a
waiter upon learning, not a mistress over learning. Yet this I
marvel not a little at, that ye think a man with a bow on his back
is more like Robin Hood's servant than Apollo's, seeing that Apollo
himself, in Alcestis of Euripides, which tragedy you read openly
not long ago, in a manner glorieth, saying this verse:--</p>
<blockquote>"It is my wont always my bow with me to
bear."</blockquote>
<p>Therefore a learned man ought not too much to be ashamed to bear
that sometime, which Apollo, god of learning, himself was not
ashamed always to bear. And because ye would have a man wait upon
the Muses, and not at all meddle with shooting: I marvel that you
do not remember how that the nine Muses their self, as soon as they
were born, were put to nurse to a lady called Euphemis, which had a
son named Erotus, with whom the nine Muses for his excellent
shooting kept evermore company withal, and used daily to shoot
together in the Mount Parnassus; and at last it chanced this Erotus
to die, whose death the Muses lamented greatly, and fell all upon
their knees afore Jupiter their father; and at their request,
Erotus, for shooting with the Muses on earth, was made a sign and
called Sagittarius in heaven. Therefore you see that if Apollo and
the Muses either were examples indeed, or only feigned of wise men
to be examples of learning, honest shooting may well enough be
companion with honest study.</p>
<p><i>Philologe</i>--Well, Toxophile, if you have no stronger
defense of shooting than poets, I fear if your companions which
love shooting heard you, they would think you made it but a
trifling and fabling matter, rather than any other man that loveth
not shooting could be persuaded by this reason to love it.</p>
<p><i>Toxophile</i>--Even as I am not so fond but I know that these
be fables, so I am sure you be not so ignorant but you know what
such noble wits as the poets had, meant by such matters; which
oftentimes, under the covering of a fable, do hide and wrap in
goodly precepts of philosophy, with the true judgment of things.
Which to be true, specially in Homer and Euripides, Plato,
Aristotle, and Galen plainly do show; when through all their works
(in a manner) they determine all controversies by these two poets
and such like authorities. Therefore, if in this matter I seem to
fable and nothing prove, I am content you judge so on me, seeing
the same judgment shall condemn with me Plato, Aristotle, and
Galen, whom in that error I am well content to follow. If these old
examples prove nothing for shooting, what say you to this, that the
best learned and sagest men in this realm which be now alive, both
love shooting and use shooting, as the best learned bishops that
be? amongst whom, Philologe, you yourself know four or five, which,
as in all good learning, virtue, and sageness, they give other men
example what thing they should do, even so by their shooting they
plainly show what honest pastime other men given to learning may
honestly use. That earnest study must be recreated with honest
pastime, sufficiently I have proved afore, both by reason and
authority of the best learned men that ever wrote. Then seeing
pastimes be leful [lawful], the most fittest for learning is to be
sought for. A pastime, saith Aristotle, must be like a medicine.
Medicines stand by contraries; therefore, the nature of studying
considered, the fittest pastime shall soon appear. In study every
part of the body is idle, which thing causeth gross and cold humors
to gather together and vex scholars very much; the mind is
altogether bent and set on work. A pastime then must be had where
every part of the body must be labored, to separate and lessen such
humors withal; the mind must be unbent, to gather and fetch again
his quickness withal. Thus pastimes for the mind only be nothing
fit for students, because the body, which is most hurt by study,
should take away no profit thereat. This knew Erasmus very well,
when he was here in Cambridge; which, when he had been sore at his
book (as Garret our book-binder had very often told me), for lack
of better exercise, would take his horse and ride about the
market-hill and come again. If a scholar should use bowls or
tennis, the labor is too vehement and unequal, which is condemned
of Galen; the example very ill for other men, when by so many acts
they be made unlawful. Running, leaping, and quoiting be too vile
for scholars, and so not fit by Aristotle's judgment; walking alone
into the field hath no token of courage in it, a pastime like a
simple man which is neither flesh nor fish. Therefore if a man
would have a pastime wholesome and equal for every part of the
body, pleasant and full of courage for the mind, not vile and
unhonest to give ill example to laymen, not kept in gardens and
corners, not lurking on the night and in holes, but evermore in the
face of men, either to rebuke it when it doeth ill, or else to
testify on it when it doth well, let him seek chiefly of all other
for shooting.</p>

<h2><a name="ATHENAEUS"></a>ATHEN&AElig;US</h2>
<h3>(Third Century A.D.)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-l.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>ittle is known that is authentic about the Gr&aelig;co-Egyptian
Sophist or man of letters, Athenaeus, author of the
'Deipnosophist&aelig;' or Feast of the Learned, except his literary
bequest. It is recorded that he was born at Naucratis, a city of
the Nile Delta; and that after living at Alexandria he migrated to
Rome. His date is presumptively fixed in the early part of the
third century by his inclusion of Ulpian, the eminent jurist (whose
death occurred A.D. 228) among the twenty-nine guests of the
banquet whose wit and learning furnished its viands. He was perhaps
a contemporary of the physician Galen, another of the putative
banqueters, who served as a mouthpiece of the author's
erudition.</p>
<p>Probably nothing concerning him deserved preservation except his
unique work, the 'Feast of the Learned.' Of the fifteen books
transmitted under the above title, the first two, and portions of
the third, eleventh, and fifteenth, exist only in epitome--the name
of the compiler and his time being equally obscure; yet it is
curious that for many centuries these garbled fragments were the
only memorials of the author extant. The other books, constituting
the major portion of the work, have been pronounced authentic by
eminent scholars with Bentley at their head. Without the slightest
pretense of literary skill, the 'Feast of the Learned' is an
immense storehouse of <i>Ana</i>, or table-talk. Into its
receptacles the author gathers fruitage from nearly every branch of
contemporary learning. He seemed to anticipate Macaulay's "vice of
omniscience," though he lacked Macaulay's incomparable literary
virtues. Personal anecdote, criticism of the fine arts, the drama,
history, poetry, philosophy, politics, medicine, and natural
history enter into his pages, illustrated with an aptness and
variety of quotation which seem to have no limit. He preserves old
songs, folk-lore, and popular gossip, and relates whatever he may
have heard, without sifting it. He gives, for example, a vivid
account of the procession which greeted Demetrius
Poliorketes:--</p>
<blockquote>"When Demetrius returned from Leucadia and Corcyra to
Athens, the Athenians received him not only with incense and
garlands and libations, but they even sent out processional
choruses, and greeted him with Ithyphallic hymns and dances.
Stationed by his chariot-wheels, they sang and danced and chanted
that he alone was a real god; the rest were sleeping or were on a
journey, or did not exist: they called him son of Poseidon and
Aphrodite, eminent for beauty, universal in his goodness to
mankind; then they prayed and besought and supplicated him like a
god."</blockquote>
<p>The hymn of worship which Athenaeus evidently disapproved has
been preserved, and turned into English by the accomplished J.A.
Symonds on account of its rare and interesting versification. It
belongs to the class of Prosodia, or processional hymns, which the
greatest poets delighted to produce, and which were sung at
religious festivals by young men and maidens, marching to the
shrines in time with the music, their locks crowned with wreaths of
olive, myrtle, or oleander; their white robes shining in the
sun.</p>
<blockquote>"See how the mightiest gods, and best beloved,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards our town are winging!<br>
For lo! Demeter and Demetrius<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This glad day is bringing!<br>
She to perform her Daughter's solemn rites;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mystic pomps attend her;<br>
He joyous as a god should be, and blithe,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comes with laughing splendor.<br>
Show forth your triumph! Friends all, troop around,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let him shine above you!<br>
Be you the stars to circle him with love;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;He's the sun to love you.<br>
Hail, offspring of Poseidon, powerful god,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Child of Aphrodite!<br>
The other deities keep far from earth;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Have no ears, though mighty;<br>
They are not, or they will not hear us wail:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee our eye beholdeth;<br>
Not wood, not stone, but living, breathing, real,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thee our prayer enfoldeth.<br>
First give us peace! Give, dearest, for thou canst;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art Lord and Master!<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;Swoops to gloat and pasture;<br>

Him punish Thou, or, if not Thou, then send<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Oedipus to harm him,<br>
Who'll cast this Sphinx down from his cliff of pride,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or to stone will charm him."</blockquote>
<p>The Swallow song, which is cited, is an example of the folk-lore
and old customs which Athenaeus delighted to gather; and he tells
how in springtime the children used to go about from door to door,
begging doles and presents, and singing such half-sensible,
half-foolish rhymes as--</p>
<blockquote>"She is here, she is here, the swallow!<br>
Fair seasons bringing, fair years to follow!<br>
Her belly is white,<br>
Her back black as night!<br>
From your rich house<br>
Roll forth to us<br>
Tarts, wine, and cheese;<br>
Or, if not these,<br>
Oatmeal and barley-cake<br>
The swallow deigns to take.<br>
What shall we have? or must we hence away!<br>
Thanks, if you give: if not, we'll make you pay!<br>
The house-door hence we'll carry;<br>
Nor shall the lintel tarry;<br>
From hearth and home your wife we'll rob;<br>
She is so small,<br>
To take her off will be an easy job!<br>
Whate'er you give, give largess free!<br>
Up! open, open, to the swallow's call!<br>
No grave old men, but merry children we!"</blockquote>
<p>The 'Feast of the Learned' professes to be the record of the
sayings at a banquet given at Rome by Laurentius to his learned
friends. Laurentius stands as the typical M&aelig;cenas of the
period. The dialogue is reported after Plato's method, or as we see
it in the more familiar form of the 'Satires' of Horace, though
lacking the pithy vigor of these models. The discursiveness with
which topics succeed each other, their want of logic or continuity,
and the pelting fire of quotations in prose and verse, make a
strange mixture. It may be compared to one of those dishes known
both to ancients and to moderns, in which a great variety of scraps
is enriched with condiments to the obliteration of all individual
flavor. The plan of execution is so cumbersome that its only
defense is its imitation of the inevitably disjointed talk when the
guests of a dinner party are busy with their wine and nuts. One is
tempted to suspect Athenaeus of a sly sarcasm at his own expense,
when he puts the following flings at pedantry in the mouths of some
of his puppets:--</p>
<blockquote>"And now when Myrtilus had said all this in a connected
statement, and when all were marveling at his memory, Cynulcus
said,--<br>
<br>
<blockquote>'Your multifarious learning I do wonder at, Though
there is not a thing more vain and useless.'</blockquote>
<br>
"Says Hippo the Atheist, 'But the divine Heraclitus also says, 'A
great variety of information does not usually give wisdom.' And
Timon said, ... 'For what is the use of so many names, my good
grammarian, which are more calculated to overwhelm the hearers than
to do them any good?'"</blockquote>
<p>This passage shows the redundancy of expression which disfigures
so much of Athenaeus. It is also typical of the cudgel-play of
repartee between his characters, which takes the place of agile
witticism. But if he heaps up vast piles of scholastic rubbish, he
is also the Golden Dustman who shows us the treasure preserved by
his saving pedantry. Scholars find the 'Feast of the Learned' a
quarry of quotations from classical writers whose works have
perished. Nearly eight hundred writers and twenty-four hundred
separate writings are referred to and cited in this disorderly
encyclopedia, most of them now lost and forgotten. This literary
thrift will always give rank to the work of Athenaeus, poor as it
is. The best editions of the original Greek are those of Dindorf
(Leipzig, 1827), and of Meineke (Leipzig, 1867). The best English
translation is that of C.D. Yonge in 'Bonn's Classical Library,'
from which, with slight alterations, the appended passages are
selected.</p>

<h2><a name="WHY_THE_NILE_OVERFLOWS"></a>WHY THE NILE
OVERFLOWS</h2>
<center>From the 'Deipnosophist&aelig;'</center>
<br>
<p>Thales the Milesian, one of the Seven Wise Men, says that the
overflowing of the Nile arises from the Etesian winds; for that
they blow up the river, and that the mouths of the river lie
exactly opposite to the point from which they blow; and
accordingly, that the wind blowing in the opposite direction
hinders the flow of the waters; and the waves of the sea, dashing
against the mouth of the river, and coming on with a fair wind in
the same direction, beat back the river, and in this manner the
Nile becomes full to overflowing. But Anaxagoras, the natural
philosopher, says that the fullness of the Nile arises from the
snow melting; and so too says Euripides, and some others of the
tragic poets. Anaxagoras says this is the sole origin of all that
fullness; but Euripides goes further and describes the exact place
where this melting of the snow takes place.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="HOW_TO_PRESERVE_THE_HEALTH"></a>HOW TO PRESERVE THE
HEALTH</h2>
<center>From the 'Deipnosophist&aelig;'</center>
<br>
<p>One ought to avoid thick perfumes, and to drink water that is
thin and clear, and that in respect of weight is light, and that
has no earthy particles in it. And that water is best which is of
moderate heat or coldness, and which, when poured into a brazen or
silver vessel, does not produce a blackish sediment. Hippocrates
says, "Water which is easily warmed or easily chilled is alway
lighter." But that water is bad which takes a long time to boil
vegetables; and so too is water full of nitre, or brackish. And in
his book 'On Waters,' Hippocrates calls good water drinkable; but
stagnant water he calls bad, such as that from ponds or marshes.
And most spring-water is rather hard.</p>
<p>Erasistratus says that some people test water by weight, and
that is a most stupid proceeding. "For just look," says he, "if men
compare the water from the fountain Amphiaraus with that from the
Eretrian spring, though one of them is good and the other bad,
there is absolutely no difference in their respective weights." And
Hippocrates, in his book 'On Places,' says that those waters are
the best which flow from high ground, and from dry hills, "for they
are white and sweet, and are able to bear very little wine, and are
warm in winter and cold in summer." And he praises those most, the
springs of which break toward the east, and especially toward the
northeast, for they must be inevitably clear and fragrant and
light. Diocles says that water is good for the digestion and not
apt to cause flatulency, that it is moderately cooling, and good
for the eyes, and that it has no tendency to make the head feel
heavy, and that it adds vigor to the mind and body. And Praxagoras
says the same; and he also praises rain-water. But Euenor praises
water from cisterns, and says that the best is that from the
cistern of Amphiaraus, when compared with that from the fountain in
Eretria.</p>
<p>That water is really nutritious is plain from the fact that some
animals are nourished by it alone, as for instance grasshoppers.
And there are many other liquids that are nutritious, such as milk,
barley water, and wine. At all events, animals at the breast are
nourished by milk; and there are many nations who drink nothing but
milk. And it is said that Democritus, the philosopher of Abdera,
after he had determined to rid himself of life on account of his
extreme old age, and after he had begun to diminish his food day by
day, when the day of the Thesmophorian festival came round, and the
women of his household besought him not to die during the festival,
in order that they might not be debarred from their share in the
festivities, was persuaded, and ordered a vessel full of honey to
be set near him: and in this way he lived many days with no other
support than honey; and then some days after, when the honey had
been taken away, he died. But Democritus had always been fond of
honey; and he once answered a man, who asked him how he could live
in the enjoyment of the best health, that he might do so if he
constantly moistened his inward parts with honey, and the outer man
with oil. And bread and honey was the chief food of the
Pythagoreans, according to the statement of Aristoxenus, who says
that those who eat this for breakfast were free from disease all
their lives. And Lycus says that the Cyrneans (a people who live
near Sardinia) are very long-lived, because they are continually
eating honey; and it is produced in great quantities among
them.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="AN_ACCOUNT_OF_SOME_GREAT_EATERS"></a>AN ACCOUNT OF
SOME GREAT EATERS</h2>
<center>From the Deipnosophist&aelig;</center>
<br>
<p>Heraclitus, in his 'Entertainer of Strangers,' says that there
was a woman named Helena who ate more than any other woman ever
did. And Posidippus, in his 'Epigrams,' says that Phuromachus was a
great eater, on whom he wrote this epigram:--</p>
<blockquote>This lowly ditch now holds Phuromachus,<br>
Who used to swallow everything he saw,<br>
Like a fierce carrion crow who roams all night.<br>
Now here he lies wrapped in a ragged cloak.<br>
But, O Athenian, whosoe'er you are,<br>
Anoint this tomb and crown it with a wreath,<br>
If ever in old times he feasted with you.<br>
At last he came <i>sans</i> teeth, with eyes worn out,<br>
And livid, swollen eyelids; clothed in skins,<br>
With but one single cruse, and that scarce full;<br>
Far from the gay Len&aelig;an Games he came,<br>
Descending humbly to Calliope.</blockquote>
<p>Amarantus of Alexandria, in his treatise on the Stage, says that
Herodorus, the Megarian trumpeter, was a man three cubits and a
half in height; and that he had great strength in his chest, and
that he could eat six pounds of bread, and twenty
<i>litr&aelig;</i> of meat, of whatever sort was provided for him,
and that he could drink two <i>choes</i> of wine; and that he could
play on two trumpets at once; and that it was his habit to sleep on
only a lion's skin, and when playing on the trumpet he made a vast
noise. Accordingly, when Demetrius the son of Antigonus was
besieging Argos, and when his troops could not bring the battering
ram against the walls on account of its weight, he, giving the
signal with his two trumpets at once, by the great volume of sound
which he poured forth, instigated the soldiers to move forward the
engine with great zeal and earnestness; and he gained the prize in
all the games ten times; and he used to eat sitting down, as Nestor
tells us in his 'Theatrical Reminiscences.' And there was a woman,
too, named Aglais, who played on the trumpet, the daughter of
Megacles, who, in the first great procession which took place in
Alexandria, played a processional piece of music; having a
head-dress of false hair on, and a crest upon her head, as
Posidippus proves by his epigrams on her. And she too could eat
twelve <i>litr&aelig;</i> of meat and four <i>choenixes</i> of
bread, and drink a <i>choenus</i> of wine, at one sitting.</p>
<p>There was besides a man of the name of Lityerses, a bastard son
of Midas, the King of Cel&aelig;n&aelig;, in Phrygia, a man of a
savage and fierce aspect, and an enormous glutton. He is mentioned
by Sositheus, the tragic poet, in his play called 'Daphnis' or
'Lityersa'; where he says:--</p>
<blockquote>"He'll eat three asses' panniers, freight and all,<br>
Three times in one brief day; and what he calls<br>
A measure of wine is a ten-amphorae cask;<br>
And this he drinks all at a single draught."</blockquote>
<p>And the man mentioned by Pherecrates, or Strattis, whichever was
the author of the play called 'The Good Men,' was much such
another; the author says:--</p>
<blockquote>"A.--I scarcely in one day, unless I'm forced,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can eat two bushels and a half of
food.<br>
&nbsp;B.--A most unhappy man! how have you lost<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your appetite, so as now to be
content<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the scant rations of one ship of
war?"</blockquote>
<p>And Xanthus, in his 'Account of Lydia,' says that Cambles, who
was the king of the Lydians, was a great eater and drinker, and
also an exceeding epicure; and accordingly, that he one night cut
up his own wife into joints and ate her; and then, in the morning,
finding the hand of his wife still sticking in his mouth, he slew
himself, as his act began to get notorious. And we have already
mentioned Thys, the king of the Paphlagonians, saying that he too
was a man of vast appetite, quoting Theopompus, who speaks of him
in the thirty-fifth book of his 'History'; and Archilochus, in his
'Tetrameters,' has accused Charilas of the same fault, as the comic
poets have attacked Cleonymus and Pisander. And Phoenicides
mentions Ch&aelig;rippus in his 'Phylarchus' in the following
terms:--</p>
<blockquote>"And next to them I place Ch&aelig;rippus third;<br>
He, as you know, will without ceasing eat<br>
As long as any one will give him food,<br>
Or till he bursts,--such stowage vast has he,<br>
Like any house."</blockquote>
<p>And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the hundred and third book of
his 'History,' says that Mithridates, the king of Pontus, once
proposed a contest in great eating and great drinking (the prize
was a talent of silver), and that he himself gained the victory in
both; but he yielded the prize to the man who was judged to be
second to him, namely, Calomodrys, the athlete of Cyzicus. And
Timocreon the Rhodian, a poet and an athlete who had gained the
victory in the pentathlum, ate and drank a great deal, as the
epigram on his tomb shows:--</p>
<blockquote>"Much did I eat, much did I drink, and much<br>
Did I abuse all men; now here I lie:--<br>
My name Timocreon, my country Rhodes."</blockquote>
<p>And Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, in one of his prefaces, says that
Timocreon came to the great king of Persia, and being entertained
by him, did eat an immense quantity of food; and when the king
asked him, What he would do on the strength of it? he said that he
would beat a great many Persians; and the next day having
vanquished a great many, one after another, taking them one by one,
after this he beat the air with his hands; and when they asked him
what he wanted, he said that he had all those blows left in him if
any one was inclined to come on. And Clearchus, in the fifth book
of his 'Lives,' says that Cantibaris the Persian, whenever his jaws
were weary with eating, had his slaves to pour food into his mouth,
which he kept open as if they were pouring it into an empty vessel.
But Hellanicus, in the first book of his Deucalionea, says that
Erysichthon, the son of Myrmidon, being a man perfectly insatiable
in respect of food, was called &AElig;thon. Also Polemo, in the
first book of his 'Treatise addressed to Tim&aelig;us,' says that
among the Sicilians there was a temple consecrated to gluttony, and
an image of Demeter Sito; near which also there was a statue of
Himalis, as there is at Delphi one of Hermuchus, and as at Scolum
in Boeotia there are statues of Megalartus and Megalomazus.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LOVE_OF_ANIMALS_FOR_MAN"></a>THE LOVE OF ANIMALS
FOR MAN</h2>
<center>From the 'Deipnosophist&aelig;'</center>
<br>
<p>And even dumb animals have fallen in love with men; for there
was a cock who took a fancy to a man of the name of Secundus, a
cupbearer of the king; and the cock was nicknamed "the Centaur."
This Secundus was a slave of Nicomedes, the king of Bithynia; as
Nicander informs us in the sixth book of his essay on 'The
Revolutions of Fortune.' And at &AElig;gium, a goose took a fancy
to a boy; as Clearchus relates in the first book of his 'Amatory
Anecdotes.' And Theophrastus, in his essay 'On Love,' says that the
name of this boy was Amphilochus, and that he was a native of
Olenus. And Hermeas the son of Hermodorus, who was a Samian by
birth, says that a goose also took a fancy to Lacydes the
philosopher. And in Leucadia (according to a story told by
Clearchus), a peacock fell so in love with a maiden there that when
she died, the bird died too. There is a story also that at Iasus a
dolphin took a fancy to a boy, and this story is told by Duris, in
the ninth book of his 'History'; and the subject of that book is
the history of Alexander, and the historian's words are
these:--</p>
<p>"He likewise sent for the boy from Iasus. For near Iasus there
was a boy whose name was Dionysius, and he once, when leaving the
pal&aelig;stra with the rest of the boys, went down to the sea and
bathed; and a dolphin came forward out of the deep water to meet
him, and taking him on his back, swam away with him a considerable
distance into the open sea, and then brought him back again to
land."</p>
<p>The dolphin is in fact an animal which is very fond of men, and
very intelligent, and one very susceptible of gratitude.
Accordingly, Phylarchus, in his twelfth book, says:--</p>
<p>"Coiranus the Milesian, when he saw some fishermen who had
caught a dolphin in a net, and who were about to cut it up, gave
them some money and bought the fish, and took it down and put it
back in the sea again. And after this it happened to him to be
shipwrecked near Myconos, and while every one else perished,
Coiranus alone was saved by a dolphin. And when at last he died of
old age in his native country, as it so happened that his funeral
procession passed along the seashore close to Miletus, a great
shoal of dolphins appeared on that day in the harbor, keeping only
a very little distance from those who were attending the funeral of
Coiranus, as if they also were joining in the procession and
sharing in their grief."</p>
<p>The same Phylarchus also relates, in the twentieth book of his
'History,' the great affection which was once displayed by an
elephant for a boy. And his words are these:--</p>
<p>"Now there was a female elephant kept with this elephant, and
the name of the female elephant was Nicaea; and to her the wife of
the king of India, when dying, intrusted her child, which was just
a month old. And when the woman did die, the affection for the
child displayed by the beast was most extraordinary; for it could
not endure the child to be away; and whenever it did not see him,
it was out of spirits. And so, whenever the nurse fed the infant
with milk, she placed it in its cradle between the feet of the
beast; and if she had not done so, the elephant would not take any
food; and after this, it would take whatever reeds and grass there
were near, and, while the child was sleeping, beat away the flies
with the bundle. And whenever the child wept, it would rock the
cradle with its trunk, and lull it to sleep. And very often the
male elephant did the same."</p>

<h2><a name="PER_DANIEL_AMADEUS_ATTERBOM"></a>PER DANIEL AMADEUS
ATTERBOM</h2>
<h3>(1790-1855)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-a.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>mong the leaders of the romantic movement which affected Swedish
literature in the earlier half of the nineteenth century was P.D.A.
Atterbom, one of the greatest lyric poets of his country. He was
born in Osterg&ouml;thland, in 1790, and at the age of fifteen was
already so advanced in his studies that he entered the University
of Upsala. There in 1807 he helped to found the "Musis Amici," a
students' society of literature and art; its membership included
Hedbom, who is remembered for his beautiful hymns, and the able and
laborious Palmblad,--author of several popular books, including the
well-known novel 'Aurora K&ouml;nigsmark.' This society soon
assumed the name of the Aurora League, and set itself to free
Swedish literature from French influence. The means chosen were the
study of German romanticism, and a treatment of the higher branches
of literature in direct opposition to the course decreed by the
Academical school. The leaders of this revolution were Atterbom,
eighteen years old, and Palmblad, twenty!</p>
<p>The first organ of the League was the Polyfem, soon replaced by
the Phosphorus (1810-1813), from which the young enthusiasts
received their sobriquet of "Phosphorists." Theoretically this
sheet was given to the discussion of Schelling's philosophy, and of
metaphysical problems in general; practically, to the publication
of the original poetry of the new school. The Phosphorists did a
good work in calling attention to the old Swedish folk-lore, and
awakening a new interest in its imaginative treasures. But their
best service lay in their forcible and earnest treatment of
religious questions, which at that time were most superficially
dealt with.</p>
<p>When the 'Phosphorus' was in its third year the Romanticists
united in bringing out two new organs: the Poetical Calendar
(1812-1822), which published poetry only, and the Swedish Literary
News (1813-1824), containing critical essays of great scientific
value. The Phosphorists, who had shown themselves ardent but not
always sagacious fighters, now appeared at their best, and dashed
into the controversy which was engaging the attention of the
Swedish reading public. This included not only literature, but
philosophy and religion, as well as art. The odds were now on one
side, now on the other. The Academicians might easily have
conquered their youthful opponents, however, had not their
bitterness continually forged new weapons against themselves. In
1820 the Phosphorists wrote the excellent satire, 'Marskall's
Sleepless Nights,' aimed at Wallmark, leader of the Academicians.
Gradually the strife died out, and the man who carried off the
palm, and for a time became the leader of Swedish poetry, was
Tegn&egrave;r, who was hardly a partisan of either side.</p>
<p>In 1817 Atterbom had gone abroad, broken down in health by his
uninterrupted studies. While in Germany he entered into a warm
friendship with Schelling and Steffens, and in Naples he met the
Danish sculptor Thorwaldsen, to whose circle of friends he became
attached. On his return he was made tutor of German and literature
to the Crown Prince. In 1828 the Chair of Logics and Metaphysics at
Upsala was offered him, and he held this for seven years, when he
exchanged it for that of Aesthetics. In 1839 he was elected a
member of the Academy whose bitterest enemy he had been, and so the
peace was signed.</p>
<p>Atterbom is undoubtedly the greatest lyrical poet in the ranks
of the Phosphorists. His verses are wonderfully melodious and full
of charm, in spite of the fact that his tendency to the mystical at
times makes him obscure. Among the best of his productions are a
cycle of lyrics entitled 'The Flowers'; 'The Isle of Blessedness,'
a romantic drama of great beauty, published in 1823; and a fragment
of a fairy drama, 'The Blue Bird.' He introduced the sonnet into
Swedish poetry, and did a great service to the national literature
by his critical work, 'Swedish Seers and Poets,' a collection of
biographies and criticisms of poets and philosophers before and
during the reign of Gustavus III. Atterbom's life may be accounted
long in the way of service, though he died at the age of
sixty-five.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="THE_GENIUS_OF_THE_NORTH"></a>THE GENIUS OF THE
NORTH</h2>
<br>
<p>It is true that our Northern nature is lofty and strong. Its
characteristics may well awaken deep meditation and emotion. When
the Goddess of Song has grown up in these surroundings, her view of
life is like that mirrored in our lakes, where, between the dark
shadows of mountain and trees on the shore, a light-blue sky looks
down. Over this mirror the Northern morning and the Northern day,
the Northern evening and the Northern night, rise in a glorious
beauty. Our Muse kindles a lofty hero's flame, a lofty seer's
flame, and always the flame of a lofty immortality. In this sombre
North we experience an immense joyousness and an immense
melancholy, moods of earth-coveting and of earth-renunciation. With
equal mind we behold the fleet, charming dream of her summers, her
early harvest with its quickly falling splendor, and the darkness
and silence of the long winter's sleep. For if the gem-like green
of the verdure proclaims its short life, it proclaims at the same
time its richness,--and in winter the very darkness seems made to
let the starry vault shine through with a glory of Valhalla and
Gimle. Indeed, in our North, the winter possesses an
impressiveness, a freshness, which only we Norsemen understand. Add
to these strong effects of nature the loneliness of life in a wide
tract of land, sparingly populated by a still sparingly educated
people, and then think of the poet's soul which must beat against
these barriers of circumstance and barriers of spirit! Yet the
barriers that hold him in as often help as hinder his striving.
These conditions explain what our literature amply proves; that so
far, the only poetical form which has reached perfection in Sweden
is the lyrical. This will be otherwise only as the northern mind,
through a growing familiarity with contemporaneous Europe, will
consent to be drawn from its forest solitude into the whirl of the
motley World's Fair outside its boundaries. It is probable that the
lyrical gift will always be the true possession of the Swedish
poet. His genius is such that it needs only a beautiful moment's
exaltation (blissful, whether the experience be called joy or
sorrow) to rise on full, free wings, suddenly singing out his very
inmost being. Whether the poet makes this inmost being his subject,
or quite forgets himself in a richer and higher theme, is of little
consequence.</p>
<p>If, again, no true lyric can express a narrow egoism, least of
all could the Swedish, in spite of the indivisible relation between
nature and man. The entire S&auml;munds-Edda shows us that
Scandinavian poetry was originally lyrical-didactic, as much
religious as heroic. Not only in lyrical impression, but also in
lyrical contemplation and lyrical expression, will the Swedish
heroic poem still follow its earliest trend. Yes, let us believe
that this impulse will some day lead Swedish poetry into the only
path of true progress, to the point where dramatic expression will
attain perfection of artistic form. This development is
foreshadowed already in the high tragic drama, in the view of the
world taken by the old Swedish didactic poem; and in some of the
songs of the Edda, as well as in many an old folk-song and
folk-play.</p>

Heaven and death are there: in his desire,<br>

<h2><a name="AUCASSIN_AND_NICOLLETE"></a>AUCASSIN AND
NICOLLETE</h2>
<h3>(Twelfth Century)</h3>
<h3>BY FREDERICK MORRIS WARREN</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>his charming tale of medieval France has reached modern times in
but one manuscript, which is now in the National Library at Paris.
It gives us no hint as to the time and place of the author, but its
linguistic forms would indicate for locality the borderland of
Champagne and Picardy, while the fact that the verse of the story
is in assonance would point to the later twelfth century as the
date of the original draft. It would thus be contemporaneous with
the last poems of Chr&eacute;tien de Troyes (1170-80). The author
was probably a minstrel by profession, but one of more than
ordinary taste and talent. For, evidently skilled in both song and
recitation, he so divided his narrative between poetry and prose
that he gave himself ample opportunity to display his powers, while
at the same time he retained more easily, by this variety, the
attention of his audience. He calls his invention--if his invention
it be--a "song-story." The subject he drew probably from
reminiscences of the widely known story of Floire and Blanchefleur;
reversing the parts, so that here it is the hero who is the
Christian, while the heroine is a Saracen captive baptized in her
early years. The general outline of the plot also resembles
indistinctly the plot of Floire and Blanchefleur, though its
topography is somewhat indefinite, and a certain amount of absurd
adventure in strange lands is interwoven with it. With these
exceptions, however, few literary productions of the Middle Ages
can rival 'Aucassin and Nicolette' in graceful sentiment and
sympathetic description.</p>
<p>The Paris manuscript gives the music for the poetical
parts,--music that is little more than a modulation. There is a
different notation for the first two lines, but for the other lines
this notation is repeated in couplets, except that the last line of
each song or <i>laisse</i>--being a half-line--has a cadence of its
own. The lines are all seven syllables in length, save the final
half-lines, and the assonance, which all but the half-lines
observe, tends somewhat towards rhyme.</p>
<p>The story begins with a song which serves as prologue; and then
its prose takes up the narrative, telling how Aucassin, son of
Garin, Count of Beaucaire, so loved Nicolette, a Saracen maiden,
who had been sold to the Viscount of Beaucaire, baptized and
adopted by him, that he had forsaken knighthood and chivalry and
even refused to defend his father's territories against Count
Bougart of Valence. Accordingly his father ordered the Viscount to
send away Nicolette, and he walled her up in a tower of his palace.
Later, Aucassin is imprisoned by his father. But Nicolette escapes,
hears him lamenting in his cell, and comforts him until the warden
on the tower warns her of the approach of the town watch. She flees
to the forest outside the gates, and there, in order to test
Aucassin's fidelity, builds a rustic tower. When he is released
from prison, Aucassin hears from shepherd lads of Nicolette's
hiding-place, and seeks her bower. The lovers, united, resolve to
leave the country. They take ship and are driven to the kingdom of
Torelore, whose queen they find in child-bed, while the king is
with the army. After a three years' stay in Torelore they are
captured by Saracen pirates and separated. Contrary winds blow
Aucassin's boat to Beaucaire, where he succeeds to Garin's estate,
while Nicolette is carried to Carthage. The sight of the city
reminds her that she is the daughter of its king, and a royal
marriage is planned for her. But she avoids this by assuming a
minstrel's garb, and setting sail for Beaucaire. There, before
Aucassin, she sings of her own adventures, and in due time makes
herself known to him. Now in one last strain our story-teller
celebrates the lovers' meeting, concluding with--</p>
<blockquote>"Our song-story comes to an end,<br>
I know no more to tell."</blockquote>
<p>And thus he takes leave of the gentle and courageous maiden.</p>
<p>The whole account of these trials and reunions does not occupy
over forty pages of the original French, which has been best edited
by H. Suchier at Paderborn (second edition, 1881). In 1878, A. Bida
published, with illustrations, a modern French version of the story
at Paris, accompanied by the original text and a preface by Gaston
Paris. This version was translated into English by A. Rodney
Macdonough under the title of 'The Lovers of Provence: Aucassin and
Nicolette' (New York, 1880). Additional illustrations by American
artists found place in this edition. F.W. Bourdillon has published
the original text and an English version, together with an
exhaustive introduction, bibliography, notes, and glossary (London,
1887), and, later in the same year, Andrew Lang wrote out another
translation, accompanied by an introduction and notes: 'Aucassin
and Nicolette' (London). The extracts given below are from Lang's
version, with occasional slight alterations.</p>

<p>How the Count Bougart of Valence made war on Count Garin of
Beaucaire,--war so great, so marvelous, and so mortal that never a
day dawned but alway he was there, by the gates and walls and
barriers of the town, with a hundred knights, and ten thousand
men-at-arms, horsemen and footmen: so burned he the Count's land,
and spoiled his country, and slew his men. Now, the Count Garin of
Beaucaire was old and frail, and his good days were gone over. No
heir had he, neither son nor daughter, save one young man only;
such an one as I shall tell you. Aucassin was the name of the
damoiseau: fair was he, goodly, and great, and featly fashioned of
his body and limbs. His hair was yellow, in little curls, his eyes
blue-gray and laughing, his face beautiful and shapely, his nose
high and well set, and so richly seen was he in all things good,
that in him was none evil at all. But so suddenly was he overtaken
of Love, who is a great master, that he would not, of his will, be
a knight, nor take arms, nor follow tourneys, nor do whatsoever him
beseemed. Therefore his father and mother said to him:--</p>
<blockquote>"Son, go take thine arms, mount thine horse, and hold
thy land, and help thy men, for if they see thee among them, more
stoutly will they keep in battle their lives and lands, and thine
and mine."<br>
<br>
"Father," answered Aucassin, "what are you saying now? Never may
God give me aught of my desire, if I be a knight, or mount my
horse, or face stour and battle wherein knights smite and are
smitten again, unless thou give me Nicolette, my true love, that I
love so well."<br>
<br>
"Son," said the father, "this may not be. Let Nicolette go. A slave
girl is she, out of a strange land, and the viscount of this town
bought her of the Saracens, and carried her hither, and hath reared
her and had her christened, and made her his god-daughter, and one
day will find a young man for her, to win her bread honorably.
Herein hast thou naught to make nor mend; but if a wife thou wilt
have, I will give thee the daughter of a king, or a count. There is
no man so rich in France, but if thou desire his daughter, thou
shall have her."<br>
<br>
"Faith! my father," said Aucassin, "tell me where is the place so
high in all the world, that Nicolette, my sweet lady and love,
would not grace it well? If she were Empress of Constantinople or
of Germany, or Queen of France or England, it were little enough
for her; so gentle is she and courteous, and debonnaire, and
compact of all good qualities."</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="IMPRISONMENT_OF_NICOLETTE"></a>IMPRISONMENT OF
NICOLETTE</h2>
<br>
<p>When Count Garin of Beaucaire knew that he would not avail to
withdraw Aucassin, his son, from the love of Nicolette, he went to
the viscount of the city, who was his man, and spake to him
saying:--"Sir Count: away with Nicolette, thy daughter in God;
cursed be the land whence she was brought into this country, for by
reason of her do I lose Aucassin, that will neither be a knight,
nor do aught of the things that fall to him to be done. And wit ye
well," he said, "that if I might have her at my will, I would burn
her in a fire, and yourself might well be sore adread."</p>
<p>"Sir," said the Viscount, "this is grievous to me that he comes
and goes and hath speech with her. I had bought the maid at mine
own charges, and nourished her, and baptized, and made her my
daughter in God. Yea, I would have given her to a young man that
should win her bread honorably. With this had Aucassin, thy son,
naught to make or mend. But sith it is thy will and thy pleasure, I
will send her into that land and that country where never will he
see her with his eyes."</p>
<p>"Have a heed to thyself," said the Count Garin: "thence might
great evil come on thee."</p>
<p>So parted they each from the other. Now the Viscount was a right
rich man: so had he a rich palace with a garden in face of it; in
an upper chamber thereof he had Nicolette placed, with one old
woman to keep her company, and in that chamber put bread and meat
and wine and such things as were needful. Then he had the door
sealed, that none might come in or go forth, save that there was
one window, over against the garden, and quite strait, through
which came to them a little air.</p>
<p><i>Here singeth one</i>:--</p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicolette as ye heard tell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prisoned is within a cell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is painted wondrously<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;With colors of a far countrie.<br>
At the window of marble wrought,<br>
There the maiden stood in thought,<br>
With straight brows and yellow hair,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Never saw ye fairer fair!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wood she gazed below,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And she saw the roses blow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Heard the birds sing loud and low,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore spoke she woefully:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah me, wherefore do I lie<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in prison wrongfully?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Aucassin, my love, my knight,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I not thy heart's delight?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou that lovest me aright!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Tis for thee that I must dwell<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In this vaulted chamber cell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard beset and all alone!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By our Lady Mary's Son<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here no longer will I wonn,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If I may flee!"</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="AUCASSIN_AND_THE_VISCOUNT"></a>AUCASSIN AND THE
VISCOUNT</h2>
<center>[<i>The Viscount speaks first</i>]</center>
<br>
<p>"Plentiful lack of comfort hadst thou got thereby; for in Hell
would thy soul have lain while the world endures, and into Paradise
wouldst thou have entered never."</p>
<p>"In Paradise what have I to win? Therein I seek not to enter,
but only to have Nicolette, my sweet lady that I love so well. For
into Paradise go none but such folk as I shall tell thee now:
Thither go these same old priests, and halt old men and maimed, who
all day and night cower continually before the altars, and in these
old crypts; and such folks as wear old amices, and old clouted
frocks, and naked folks and shoeless, and those covered with sores,
who perish of hunger and thirst, and of cold, and of wretchedness.
These be they that go into Paradise; with them have I naught to
make. But into Hell would I fain go; for into Hell fare the goodly
clerks, and goodly knights that fall in tourneys and great wars,
and stout men-at-arms, and the free men. With these would I liefly
go. And thither pass the sweet ladies and courteous, that have two
lovers, or three, and their lords also thereto. Thither goes the
gold, and the silver, and fur of vair, and fur of gris; and there
too go the harpers, and minstrels, and the kings of this world.
With these I would gladly go, let me but have with me Nicolette, my
sweetest lady."</p>
<br>
<h3>AUCASSIN CAPTURES COUNT BOUGART</h3>
<p>The damoiseau was tall and strong, and the horse whereon he sat
was right eager. And he laid hand to sword, and fell a-smiting to
right and left, and smote through helm and nasal, and arm, and
clenched hand, making a murder about him, like a wild boar when
hounds fall on him in the forest, even till he struck down ten
knights, and seven he hurt; and straightway he hurled out of the
press, and rode back again at full speed, sword in hand. Count
Bougart of Valence heard it said that they were to hang Aucassin,
his enemy, so he came into that place and Aucassin was ware of him.
He gat his sword into his hand, and struck at his helm with such a
stroke that it drave it down on his head, and he being stunned,
fell groveling. And Aucassin laid hands on him, and caught him by
the nasal of his helmet, and gave him up to his father.</p>
<p>"Father," quoth Aucassin, "lo, here is your mortal foe, who hath
so warred on you and done you such evil. Full twenty months did
this war endure, and might not be ended by man."</p>
<p>"Fair son," said his father, "thy feats of youth shouldst them
do, and not seek after folly."</p>
<p>"Father," saith Aucassin, "sermon me no sermons, but fulfill my
covenant."</p>
<p>"Ha! what covenant, fair son?"</p>
<p>"What, father! hast thou forgotten it? By mine own head,
whosoever forgets, will I not forget it, so much it hath me at
heart. Didst thou not covenant with me when I took up arms, and
went into the stour, that if God brought me back safe and sound,
thou wouldst let me see Nicolette, my sweet lady, even so long that
I may have of her two words or three, and one kiss? So didst thou
covenant, and my mind is that thou keep thy word."</p>
<p>"I?" quoth the father; "God forsake me when I keep this
covenant! Nay, if she were here, I would have burned her in the
fire, and thou thyself shouldst be sore adread."</p>
<br>
<h3>THE LOVERS' MEETING</h3>
<p>Aucassin was cast into prison as ye have heard tell, and
Nicolette, of her part, was in the chamber. Now it was summer-time,
the month of May, when days are warm, and long, and clear, and the
nights still and serene. Nicolette lay one night on her bed, and
saw the moon shine clear through a window, and heard the
nightingale sing in the garden, and she minded her of Aucassin her
friend, whom she loved so well. Then fell she to thoughts of Count
Garin of Beaucaire, that he hated her to death; and therefore
deemed she that there she would no longer abide, for that, if she
were told of, and the Count knew where she lay, an ill death he
would make her die. She saw that the old woman was sleeping who
held her company. Then she arose, and clad her in a mantle of silk
she had by her, very goodly, and took sheets of the bed and towels
and knotted one to the other, and made therewith a cord as long as
she might, and knotted it to a pillar in the window, and let
herself slip down into the garden; then caught up her raiment in
both hands, behind and before, and kilted up her kirtle, because of
the dew that she saw lying deep on the grass, and so went on her
way down through the garden.</p>
<p>Her locks were yellow and curled, her eyes blue-gray and
smiling, her face featly fashioned, the nose high and fairly set,
the lips more red than cherry or rose in time of summer, her teeth
white and small; and her breasts so firm that they bore up the
folds of her bodice as they had been two walnuts; so slim was she
in the waist that your two hands might have clipped her; and the
daisy flowers that brake beneath her as she went tiptoe, and that
bent above her instep, seemed black against her feet and ankles, so
white was the maiden. She came to the postern-gate, and unbarred
it, and went out through the streets of Beaucaire, keeping always
on the shadowy side, for the moon was shining right clear, and so
wandered she till she came to the tower where her lover lay. The
tower was flanked with pillars, and she cowered under one of them,
wrapped in her mantle. Then thrust she her head through a crevice
of the tower, that was old and worn, and heard Aucassin, who was
weeping within, and making dole and lament for the sweet friend he
loved so well. And when she had listened to him some time she began
to say:--</p>
<br>
<p><i>Here one singeth</i>:--</p>
<blockquote>Nicolette, the bright of brow,<br>
On a pillar leaned now,<br>
All Aucassin's wail did hear<br>
For his love that was so dear,<br>
Then the maid spake low and clear:--<br>
"Gentle knight, withouten fear,<br>
Little good befalleth thee,<br>
Little help of sigh or tear.<br>
Ne'er shalt thou have joy of me.<br>
Never shalt thou win me; still<br>
Am I held in evil will<br>
Of thy father and thy kin.<br>
Therefore must I cross the sea,<br>
And another land must win."<br>
Then she cut her curls of gold,<br>
Cast them in the dungeon hold,<br>
Aucassin doth clasp them there,<br>
Kiss'th the curls that were so fair,<br>
Them doth in his bosom bear,<br>
Then he wept, e'en as of old,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All for his love!<br>
<br>
Thus say they, speak they, tell they The Tale.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>When Aucassin heard Nicolette say that she would pass into a far
country, he was all in wrath.</p>
<p>"Fair, sweet friend," quoth he, "thou shalt not go, for then
wouldst thou be my death. And the first man that saw thee and had
the might withal, would take thee straightway into his bed to be
his leman. And once thou earnest into a man's bed, and that bed not
mine, wit ye well that I would not tarry till I had found a knife
to pierce my heart and slay myself. Nay, verily, wait so long I
would not; but would hurl myself so far as I might see a wall, or a
black stone, and I would dash my head against it so mightily that
the eyes would start and my brain burst. Rather would I die even
such a death than know that thou hadst lain in a man's bed, and
that bed not mine."</p>
<p>"Aucassin," she said, "I trow thou lovest me not as much as thou
sayest, but I love thee more than thou lovest me."</p>
<p>"Ah, fair, sweet friend," said Aucassin, "it may not be that
thou shouldest love me even as I love thee. Woman may not love man
as man loves woman; for a woman's love lies in her eye, and the bud
of her breast, and her foot's tiptoe, but the love of a man is in
his heart planted, whence it can never issue forth and pass
away."</p>
<p>Now when Aucassin and Nicolette were holding this parley
together, the town's watchmen were coming down a street, with
swords drawn beneath their cloaks, for Count Garin had charged them
that if they could take her, they should slay her. But the sentinel
that was on the tower saw them coming, and heard them speaking of
Nicolette as they went, and threatening to slay her.</p>
<p>"God," quoth he, "this were great pity to slay so fair a maid!
Right great charity it were if I could say aught to her, and they
perceive it not, and she should be on her guard against them, for
if they slay her, then were Aucassin, my damoiseau, dead, and that
were great pity."</p>
<p><i>Here one singeth</i>:--</p>
<blockquote>Valiant was the sentinel,<br>
Courteous, kind, and practiced well,<br>
So a song did sing and tell,<br>
Of the peril that befell.<br>
"Maiden fair that lingerest here,<br>
Gentle maid of merry cheer,<br>
Hair of gold, and eyes as clear<br>
As the water in a mere,<br>
Thou, meseems, hast spoken word<br>
To thy lover and thy lord,<br>
That would die for thee, his dear;<br>
Now beware the ill accord<br>
Of the cloaked men of the sword:<br>
These have sworn, and keep their word,<br>
They will put thee to the sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Save thou take heed!"</blockquote>

<b>NICOLETTE BUILDS HER LODGE</b></p>
<blockquote>Nicolette, the bright of brow,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;From the shepherds doth she pass<br>
All below the blossomed bough<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where an ancient way there was,<br>
Overgrown and choked with grass,<br>
Till she found the cross-roads where<br>
Seven paths do all way fare;<br>
Then she deemeth she will try,<br>
Should her lover pass thereby,<br>
If he love her loyally.<br>
So she gathered white lilies,<br>
Oak-leaf, that in greenwood is,<br>
Leaves of many a branch, iwis,<br>
Therewith built a lodge of green,<br>
Goodlier was never seen.<br>
Swore by God, who may not lie:<br>
"If my love the lodge should spy,<br>
He will rest a while thereby<br>
If he love me loyally."<br>
Thus his faith she deemed to try,<br>
"Or I love him not, not I,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor he loves me!"</blockquote>

<br>
<h3>AUCASSIN, SEEKING NICOLETTE, COMES UPON A COWHERD</h3>
<p>Aucassin fared through the forest from path to path after
Nicolette, and his horse bare him furiously. Think ye not that the
thorns him spared, nor the briars, nay, not so, but tare his
raiment, that scarce a knot might be tied with the soundest part
thereof, and the blood spurted from his arms, and flanks, and legs,
in forty places, or thirty, so that behind the Childe men might
follow on the track of his blood in the grass. But so much he went
in thoughts of Nicolette, his lady sweet, that he felt no pain nor
torment, and all the day hurled through the forest in this fashion
nor heard no word of her. And when he saw vespers draw nigh, he
began to weep for that he found her not. All down an old road, and
grass-grown, he fared, when anon, looking along the way before him,
he saw such an one as I shall tell you. Tall was he, and great of
growth, ugly and hideous: his head huge, and blacker than charcoal,
and more than the breadth of a hand between his two eyes; and he
had great cheeks, and a big nose and flat, big nostrils and wide,
and thick lips redder than steak, and great teeth yellow and ugly,
and he was shod with hosen and shoon of ox-hide, bound with cords
of bark up over the knee, and all about him a great cloak two-fold;
and he leaned upon a grievous cudgel, and Aucassin came unto him,
and was afraid when he beheld him.</p>
<br>
<h3>AUCASSIN FINDS NICOLETTE'S LODGE</h3>
<p>So they parted from each other, and Aucassin rode on; the night
was fair and still, and so long he went that he came to the lodge
of boughs that Nicolette had builded and woven within and without,
over and under, with flowers, and it was the fairest lodge that
might be seen. When Aucassin was ware of it, he stopped suddenly,
and the light of the moon fell therein.</p>
<p>"Forsooth!" quoth Aucassin, "here was Nicolette, my sweet lady,
and this lodge builded she with her fair hands. For the sweetness
of it, and for love of her, will I now alight, and rest here this
night long."</p>
<p>He drew forth his foot from the stirrup to alight, and the steed
was great and tall. He dreamed so much on Nicolette, his right
sweet friend, that he fell heavily upon a stone, and drave his
shoulder out of its place. Then knew he that he was hurt sore;
nathless he bore him with that force he might, and fastened his
horse with the other hand to a thorn. Then turned he on his side,
and crept backwise into the lodge of boughs. And he looked through
a gap in the lodge and saw the stars in heaven, and one that was
brighter than the rest; so began he to say:--</p>
<p><i>Here one singeth</i>:--</p>
<blockquote>"Star, that I from far behold,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Star the moon calls to her fold,<br>
Nicolette with thee doth dwell,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My sweet love, with locks of gold.<br>
God would have her dwell afar,<br>
Dwell with him for evening star.<br>
Would to God, whate'er befell,<br>
Would that with her I might dwell.<br>
I would clip her close and strait;<br>
Nay, were I of much estate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some king's son desirable,<br>
Worthy she to be my mate,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Me to kiss and clip me well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sister, sweet friend!"<br>
<br>
So speak they, say they, tell they The Tale.</blockquote>
<br>
<p>When Nicolette heard Aucassin, she came to him, for she was not
far away. She passed within the lodge, and threw her arms about his
neck, clipped him and kissed him.</p>
<p>"Fair, sweet friend, welcome be thou!"</p>
<p>"And thou, fair, sweet love, be thou welcome!"</p>
<p>So either kissed and clipped the other, and fair joy was them
between.</p>
<p>"Ha! sweet love," quoth Aucassin, "but now was I sore hurt, and
my shoulder wried, but I take no heed of it, nor have no hurt
therefrom, since I have thee."</p>
<p>Right so felt she his shoulder and found it was wried from its
place. And she so handled it with her white hands, and so wrought
in her surgery, that by God's will who loveth lovers, it went back
into its place. Then took she flowers, and fresh grass, and leaves
green, and bound them on the hurt with a strip of her smock, and he
was all healed.</p>
<br>
<h3>NICOLETTE SAILS TO CARTHAGE</h3>
<p>When all they of the court heard her speak thus, that she was
daughter to the king of Carthage, they knew well that she spake
truly; so made they great joy of her, and led her to the castle
with great honor, as a king's daughter. And they would have given
her to her lord a king of Paynim, but she had no mind to marry.
There dwelt she three days or four. And she considered by what
device she might seek far Aucassin. Then she got her a viol, and
learned to play on it; till they would have married her one day to
a rich king of Paynim, and she stole forth by night, and came to
the seaport, and dwelt with a poor woman thereby. Then took she a
certain herb, and therewith smeared her head and her face, till she
was all brown and stained. And she had a coat, and mantle, and
smock, and breeches made, and attired herself as if she had been a
minstrel. So took she the viol and went to a mariner, and so
wrought on him that he took her aboard his vessel. Then hoisted
they sail, and fared on the high seas even till they came to the
land of Provence. And Nicolette went forth and took the viol, and
went playing through all the country, even till she came to the
castle of Beaucaire, where Aucassin was.</p>
<p><i>Here singeth one</i>:--</p>
<blockquote>At Beaucaire below the tower<br>
Sat Aucassin on an hour,<br>
Heard the bird, and watched the flower,<br>
With his barons him beside.<br>
Then came on him in that tide<br>
The sweet influence of love<br>
And the memory thereof;<br>
Thought of Nicolette the fair,<br>
And the dainty face of her<br>
He had loved so many years.<br>
Then was he in dule and tears!<br>
Even then came Nicolette;<br>
On the stair a foot she set,<br>
And she drew the viol bow<br>
O'er the strings and chanted so:--<br>
"Listen, lords and knights, to me,<br>
Lords of high or low degree,<br>
To my story list will ye<br>
All of Aucassin and her<br>
That was Nicolette the fair?<br>
And their love was long to tell;<br>
Deep woods through he sought her well:<br>
Paynims took them on a day<br>
In Torelore, and bound they lay.<br>
Of Aucassin naught know we,<br>
But fair Nicolette the free<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Now in Carthage doth she dwell;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There her father loves her well,<br>
Who is king of that countrie.<br>
Her a husband hath he found,<br>
Paynim lord that serves Mahound!<br>
Ne'er with him the maid will go,<br>
For she loves a damoiseau,<br>
Aucassin, that ye may know,<br>
Swears to God that never mo<br>
With a lover will she go<br>
Save with him she loveth so<br>
In long desire."</blockquote>

<h2><a name="JOHN_JAMES_AUDUBON"></a>JOHN JAMES AUDUBON</h2>
<h3>(1780-1851)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he fame of this celebrated naturalist rests on one magnificent
book, 'The Birds of America,' for which all his life may be said to
have been a preparation, and which certainly surpasses in interest
every other ornithological publication. For fifteen years before he
thought of making use of his collections in this way, he annually
went alone with his gun and his drawing materials into deep and
unexplored forests and through wild regions of country, making long
journeys on foot and counting nothing a hardship that added to his
specimens. This passion had controlled him from early childhood.
His father, a Frenchman, was living in New Orleans at the time of
Audubon's birth in 1780, and with the view of helping him in his
studies, sent him to Paris when he was fifteen years old, where he
entered the drawing-class of David the painter. He remained there
two years; and it was after his return that he made his memorable
excursions, his home being then a farm at Mill Grove, near
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In 1808 he removed with his family to the West, still continuing
his researches. Several years later he returned to Philadelphia
with a portfolio of nearly a thousand colored drawings of birds.
What befell them--a parallel to so many like incidents, as through
Warburton's cook, Newton's dog, Carlyle's friend, and Edward
Livingston's fire, that they seem one of the appointed tests of
moral fibre--is best told in Audubon's own language:--</p>
<p>"An accident," he says, "which happened to two hundred of my
original drawings, nearly put a stop to my researches in
ornithology. I shall relate it, merely to show how far
enthusiasm--for by no other name can I call my perseverance--may
enable the preserver of nature to surmount the most disheartening
difficulties. I left the village of Henderson, in Kentucky,
situated on the banks of the Ohio, where I resided for several
years, to proceed to Philadelphia on business. I looked to my
drawings before my departure, placed them carefully in a wooden
box, and gave them in charge of a relative, with injunctions to see
that no injury should happen to them. My absence was of several
months; and when I returned, after having enjoyed the pleasures of
home for a few days, I inquired after my box, and what I was
pleased to call my treasure. The box was produced and opened; but,
reader, feel for me,--a pair of Norway rats had taken possession of
the whole, and reared a young family among the gnawed bits of
paper, which, but a month previous, represented nearly a thousand
inhabitants of air! The burning heat which instantly rushed through
my brain was too great to be endured without affecting my whole
nervous system. I slept not for several nights, and the days passed
like days of oblivion;--until, the animal powers being recalled
into action through the strength of my constitution, I took up my
gun, my note-book, and my pencils, and went forth to the woods as
gayly as if nothing had happened. I felt pleased that I might now
make better drawings than before; and ere a period not exceeding
three years had elapsed, my portfolio was again filled."</p>

<p class="ctr"><img src="images/illus0956.jpg" width="50%" alt=
""></p>
<br>
<p>In 1826 he sailed for Europe to exhibit his newly collected
treasures to foreign ornithologists. He succeeded in obtaining
pecuniary aid in publishing the work, and plates were made in
England. The book was published in New York in four volumes
(elephant folio) in 1830-39. The birds are life-size. 'The American
Ornithological Biography,' which is the text for the plates, was
published in Edinburgh, 1831-39, in five octavo volumes.
Accompanied by his two sons he started on new excursions, which
resulted in 'The Quadrupeds of America,' with a 'Biography of
American Quadrupeds,' both published at Philadelphia, beginning in
1840. During that year he built a house for himself in the upper
part of New York, in what is now called Audubon Park, and died
there January 27th, 1851.</p>
<p>Audubon's descriptive text is not unworthy of his plates: his
works are far from being mere tenders to picture-books. He is full
of enthusiasm, his descriptions of birds and animals are vivid and
realizing, and his adventures are told with much spirit and
considerable literary skill, though some carelessness of
syntax.</p>
<br>
<h2><a name="A_DANGEROUS_ADVENTURE"></a>A DANGEROUS ADVENTURE</h2>
<center>From 'The American Ornithological Biography'</center>
<br>
<p>On my return from the Upper Mississippi, I found myself obliged
to cross one of the wide prairies which, in that portion of the
United States, vary the appearance of the country. The weather was
fine, all around me was as fresh and blooming as if it had just
issued from the bosom of nature. My knapsack, my gun, and my dog,
were all I had for baggage and company. But although well
moccasined, I moved slowly along, attracted by the brilliancy of
the flowers, and the gambols of the fawns around their dams, to all
appearance as thoughtless of danger as I felt myself.</p>
<p>My march was of long duration; I saw the sun sinking beneath the
horizon long before I could perceive any appearance of woodland,
and nothing in the shape of man had I met with that day. The track
which I followed was only an old Indian trace; and, as darkness
overshadowed the prairie, I felt some desire to reach at least a
copse, in which I might lie down to rest. The night-hawks were
skimming over and around me, attracted by the buzzing wings of the
beetles which formed their food, and the distant howling of wolves
gave me some hope that I should soon arrive at the skirts of some
woodland.</p>
<p>I did so, and almost at the same instant a fire-light attracting
my eye, I moved toward it, full of confidence that it proceeded
from the camp of some wandering Indians. I was mistaken. I
discovered by its glare that it was from the hearth of a small log
cabin, and that a tall figure passed and repassed between it and
me, as if busily engaged in household arrangements.</p>
<p>I reached the spot, and presenting myself at the door, asked the
tall figure, which proved to be a woman, if I might take shelter
under her roof for the night. Her voice was gruff, and her attire
negligently thrown about her. She answered in the affirmative. I
walked in, took a wooden stool, and quietly seated myself by the
fire. The next object that attracted my notice was a finely formed
young Indian, resting his head between his hands, with his elbows
on his knees. A long bow rested against the log wall near him,
while a quantity of arrows and two or three raccoon skins lay at
his feet. He moved not; he apparently breathed not. Accustomed to
the habits of the Indians, and knowing that they pay little
attention to the approach of civilized strangers (a circumstance
which in some countries is considered as evincing the apathy of
their character), I addressed him in French, a language not
unfrequently partially known to the people in that neighborhood. He
raised his head, pointed to one of his eyes with his finger, and
gave me a significant glance with the other. His face was covered
with blood. The fact was, that an hour before this, as he was in
the act of discharging an arrow at a raccoon in the top of a tree,
the arrow had split upon the cord, and sprung back with such
violence into his right eye as to destroy it forever.</p>
<p>Feeling hungry, I inquired what sort of fare I might expect.
Such a thing as a bed was not to be seen, but many large untanned
bear and buffalo hides lay piled in a corner. I drew a fine
timepiece from my breast, and told the woman that it was late, and
that I was fatigued. She had espied my watch, the richness of which
seemed to operate upon her feelings with electric quickness. She
told me that there was plenty of venison and jerked buffalo meat,
and that on removing the ashes I should find a cake. But my watch
had struck her fancy, and her curiosity had to be gratified by an
immediate sight of it. I took off the gold chain that secured it,
from around my neck, and presented it to her. She was all ecstasy,
spoke of its beauty, asked me its value, and put the chain round
her brawny neck, saying how happy the possession of such a watch
should make her. Thoughtless, and as I fancied myself, in so
retired a spot, secure, I paid little attention to her talk or her
movements. I helped my dog to a good supper of venison, and was not
long in satisfying the demands of my own appetite.</p>
<p>The Indian rose from his seat, as if in extreme suffering. He
passed me and repassed me several times, and once pinched me on the
side so violently that the pain nearly brought forth an exclamation
of anger. I looked at him. His eye met mine; but his look was so
forbidding that it struck a chill into the more nervous part of my
system. He again seated himself, drew his butcher-knife from its
greasy scabbard, examined its edge, as I would do that of a razor
suspected dull, replaced it, and again taking his tomahawk from his
back, filled the pipe of it with tobacco, and sent me expressive
glances whenever our hostess chanced to have her back towards
us.</p>
<p>Never until that moment had my senses been awakened to the
danger which I now suspected to be about me. I returned glance for
glance to my companion, and rested well assured that whatever
enemies I might have, he was not of their number.</p>
<p>I asked the woman for my watch, wound it up, and under pretense
of wishing to see how the weather might probably be on the morrow,
took up my gun, and walked out of the cabin. I slipped a ball into
each barrel, scraped the edges of my flints, renewed the primings,
and returning to the hut, gave a favorable account of my
observations. I took a few bear-skins, made a pallet of them, and
calling my faithful dog to my side, lay down, with my gun close to
my body, and in a few minutes was to all appearance fast
asleep.</p>
<p>A short time had elapsed, when some voices were heard; and from
the corner of my eyes I saw two athletic youths making their
entrance, bearing a dead stag on a pole. They disposed of their
burden, and asking for whisky, helped themselves freely to it.
Observing me and the wounded Indian, they asked who I was, and why
the devil that rascal (meaning the Indian, who, they knew,
understood not a word of English) was in the house. The mother--for
so she proved to be--bade them speak less loudly, made mention of
my watch, and took them to a corner, where a conversation took
place, the purport of which it required little shrewdness in me to
guess. I tapped my dog gently. He moved his tail, and with
indescribable pleasure I saw his fine eyes alternately fixed on me
and raised toward the trio in the corner. I felt that he perceived
danger in my situation. The Indian exchanged a last glance with
me.</p>
<p>The lads had eaten and drunk themselves into such condition that
I already looked upon them as <i>hors tie combat</i>; and the
frequent visits of the whisky bottle to the ugly mouth of their dam
I hoped would soon reduce her to a like state. Judge of my
astonishment, reader, when I saw this incarnate fiend take a large
carving-knife and go to the grindstone to whet its edge. I saw her
pour the water on the turning machine, and watched her working away
with the dangerous instrument, until the cold sweat covered every
part of my body, in spite of my determination to defend myself to
the last. Her task finished, she walked to her reeling sons, and
said, "There, that'll soon settle him! Boys, kill yon--, and then
for the watch."</p>
<p>I turned, cocked my gunlocks silently, touched my faithful
companion, and lay ready to start up and shoot the first one who
might attempt my life. The moment was fast approaching, and that
night might have been my last in the world, had not Providence made
preparations for my rescue. All was ready. The infernal hag was
advancing slowly, probably contemplating the best way of
dispatching me, while her sons should be engaged with the Indian. I
was several times on the point of rising and shooting her on the
spot;--but she was not to be punished thus. The door was suddenly
opened, and there entered two stout travelers, each with a long
rifle on his shoulder. I bounced up on my feet, and making them
most heartily welcome, told them how well it was for me that they
should have arrived at that moment. The tale was told in a minute.
The drunken sons were secured, and the woman, in spite of her
defense and vociferations, shared the same fate. The Indian fairly
danced with joy, and gave us to understand that as he could not
sleep for pain, he would watch over us. You may suppose we slept
much less than we talked. The two strangers gave me an account of
their once having been themselves in a somewhat similar
situation.</p>
<p>Day came, fair and rosy, and with it the punishment of our
captives. They were now quite sobered. Their feet were unbound, but
their arms were still securely tied. We marched them into the woods
off the road, and having used them as Regulators were wont to use
such delinquents, we set fire to the cabin, gave all the skins and
implements to the young Indian warrior, and proceeded, well
pleased, towards the settlements.</p>
<p>During upward of twenty-five years, when my wanderings extended
to all parts of our country, this was the only time at which my
life was in danger from my fellow-creatures. Indeed, so little risk
do travelers run in the United States, that no one born there ever
dreams of any to be encountered on the road, and I can only account
for this occurrence by supposing that the inhabitants of the cabin
were not Americans.</p>
<p>Will you believe, good-natured reader, that not many miles from
the place where this adventure happened, and where fifteen years
ago, no habitation belonging to civilized man was expected, and
very few ever seen, large roads are now laid out, cultivation has
converted the woods into fertile fields, taverns have been erected,
and much of what we Americans call comfort is to be met with! So
fast does improvement proceed in our abundant and free country.</p>

<h2><a name="BERTHOLD_AUERBACH"></a>BERTHOLD AUERBACH</h2>
<h3>(1812-1882)</h3>
<br>
<p class="par"><img src="images/letter-t.png" width="30%" alt=
""></p>
<p>he author of 'Black Forest Village Stories' and 'On the Heights'
stands out in honorable individuality among modern German
novelists, even if the latest fashions in fiction make his work
already a little antiquated. Auerbach's biography is one of
industry rather than of incident. His birth was humble. His life
was long. He wrote voluminously and was widely popular, to be half
forgotten within a decade after his death. He may perhaps be
reckoned the founder of a contemporary German school of
<i>tendenz</i> novel writers; a school now so much diminished that
Spielhagen--who, however, wears Auerbach's mantle with a
difference--is its only survivor.</p>
<p>Of Jewish parentage, his birthplace being Nordstetten,
W&uuml;rtemberg (1812), Auerbach drifted from preparation for the
synagogue toward law, philosophy, and literature. The study of
Spinoza (whose works he translated) gave form to his convictions
concerning human life. It led him to spend his literary talents on
materials so various as the homely simplicity of peasant scenes and
peasant souls, on the one hand, and on the other the popularization
of a high social and ethical philosophy, specially inculcated
through his larger fictions. His college education was obtained at
T&uuml;bingen, Munich, and Heidelberg.</p>
<p>Necessity rather than ambition prompted him to write, and he
wrote as long as he lived. A partial list of his works begins with
a pseudonymous 'Life of Frederick the Great' (1834-36), and 'Das
Judenthum und der Neuste Literatur' (The Jew Element in Recent
Literature: 1836), and passes to the semi-biographic novel
'Spinoza' (1837), afterward supplemented with 'Ein Denkerleben' (A
Thinker's Life), 'Dichter und Kaufman' (Poet and Merchant:
1839),--stories belonging to the 'Ghetto Series,' embodying Jewish
and German life in the time of Moses Mendelssohn; the translation
in five volumes of Spinoza's philosophy, with a critical biography,
1841; and in 1842 another work intended to popularize philosophy,
'Der Gebildete B&uuml;rger: ein Buch f&uuml;r den Denkenden
Menschen' (The Clever Townsman: a Book for Thinking Men).</p>
<p class="lft"><img src="images/image-512.png" width="40%" alt=
""><br>
<b>BERTHOLD AUERBACH</b></p>
<p>In 1843 came the first set of the famous 'Schwarzw&auml;lder
Dorfgeschichten' (Black Forest Village Stories), followed by a
second group in 1848. These won instant and wide favor, and were
widely translated. They rank among the author's most pleasing and
successful productions, stamped as they are with that truth which a
writer like Auerbach, or a painter like Defregger or Schmidt, can
express when sitting down to deal with the scenes and folk which
from early youth have been photographed upon his heart and memory.
In 1856 there followed in the same descriptive field his
'Barf&uuml;ssele' (Little Barefoot), 'Joseph im Schnee' (Joseph in
the Snow: 1861), and 'Edelweiss' (1861). His writings of this
date--tales, sketches journalistic, political, and dramatic, and
other papers--reveal Auerbach's varying moods or enthusiasms,
chronicle his residence in different German or Austrian cities, and
are comparatively insignificant among his forty or more volumes.
Nor is much to be said of his first long fiction, 'Neues Leben'
(New Life).</p>
<p>But with 'Auf der H&ouml;he' (On the Heights), a philosophic
romance of court life in the capital and the royal country seat of
a considerable German kingdom (by no means merely imaginary),
inwoven with a minute study of peasant life and character,
Auerbach's popular reputation was established. His plan of making
ethics the chief end of a novel was here exhibited at its best; he
never again showed the same force of conception which got his
imperfect literary art forgiven. Another long novel, not less
doctrinaire in scope, but dealing with quite different materials
and problems, 'Das Landhaus am Rhein' (The Villa on the Rhine), was
issued in 1868; and was followed by 'Waldfried,' a long, patriotic,
and on the whole inert, study of a German family from 1848 until
the close of the Franco-Prussian War.</p>
<p>In spite of his untiring industry, Auerbach produced little more
of consequence, though he wrote a new series of Black Forest
sketches: 'Nach Dreissig Jahren' (After Thirty Years: 1876); 'Der
Forstmeister' (The Head Forester: 1879); and 'Brigitta' (1880). The
close of his life was much embittered by the growth of the
anti-Semitic sentiment; and his residence in Germany was merely
nominal. He died at Cannes, France, in 1882.</p>
<p>'On the Heights' is doubtless Auerbach's best representative.
'The Villa on the Rhine' is in a lower key, with less appealing
types, and less attractive local color. Moreover, it is weighted
with more philosophizing, and its movement is slower. In 'On the
Heights' the emotional situations are strong. In spite of
sentimentality, a true feeling animates its technique. The
atmosphere of a German royal residence, as he reveals it, appears
almost as heavy as the real thing. Auerbach's humor is leaden; he
finds it necessary to explain his own attempts at it. But the
peasant-nurse Walpurga, her husband Hansei, and the aged
grandmother in the family, are admirable delineations. The heroine,
Irma von Wildenort, is genuinely human. The story of her abrupt
atonement for a lapse from her better self, the gradual process of
her fantastic expiation and of her self-redemption,--through the
deliberate sacrifice of all that belongs to her treacherous
past,--her successful struggle into a high ethical life and
knowledge of herself (the element which gives the book its force),
offer much that is consistent, and appealing and elevating to the
conscience.</p>
<p>Auerbach crowds material into the book, tangles up too many
different skeins of plot, offers too many types to study and
interests to follow, and betrays a want of perspective in its
construction. But in spite of all its defects it is a novel that
should not be forgotten. For reflective readers it will always hold
a charm, and its latent strength is proved by its triumph over its

<h2><a name="THE_FIRST_MASS"></a>THE FIRST MASS</h2>
<center>From "Ivo the Gentleman," in "Black Forest Village
Stories"</center>
<br>
<p>One Saturday afternoon the busy sound of hammer and adze was
heard on the green hill-top which served the good folks of
Nordstetten as their open-air gathering-place. Valentine the
carpenter, with his two sons, was making a scaffolding, designed to
serve no less a purpose than that of an altar and a pulpit.
Gregory, the son of Christian the tailor, was to officiate at his
first mass and preach his first sermon.</p>
<p>Ivo, Valentine's youngest son, a child of six years of age,
assisted his father with a mien which betokened that he considered
his services indispensable. With his bare head and feet he ran up
and down the timbers as nimbly as a squirrel. When a beam was being
lifted, he cried, "Pry under!" as lustily as any one, put his
shoulder to the crowbar, and puffed as if nine-tenths of the weight
fell upon him. Valentine liked to see his little boy employed. He
would tell him to wind the twine on the reel, to carry the tools
where they were wanted, or to rake the chips into a heap. Ivo
obeyed all these directions with the zeal and devotion of a
self-sacrificing patriot. Once, when he perched upon the end of a
plank for the purpose of weighing it down, the motion of the saw
shook his every limb, and made him laugh aloud in spite of himself;
he would have fallen off but for the eagerness with which he held
on to his position and endeavored to perform his task in the most
workmanlike manner.</p>
<p>At last the scaffolding was finished. Lewis the saddler was
ready to nail down the carpets and hanging. Ivo offered to help him
too; but being gruffly repelled, he sat down upon his heap of
chips, and looked at the mountains, behind which the sun was
setting in a sea of fire. His father's whistle aroused him, and he
ran to his side.</p>
<p>"Father," said Ivo, "I wish I was in Hochdorf."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because it's so near to heaven, and I should like to climb up
once."</p>
<p>"You silly boy, it only seems as if heaven began there. From
Hochdorf it is a long way to Stuttgart, and from there it is a long
way to heaven yet.</p>
<p>"How long?"</p>
<p>"Well, you can't get there until you die."</p>
<p>Leading his little son with one hand, and carrying his tools in
the other, Valentine passed through the village. Washing and
scouring was going on everywhere, and chairs and tables stood
before the houses,--for every family expected visitors for the
great occasion of the morrow.</p>
<p>As Valentine passed Christian the tailor's, he held his hand to
his cap, prepared to take it off if anybody should look out. But
nobody did so: the place was silent as a cloister. Some farmers'
wives were going in, carrying bowls covered with their aprons,
while others passed out with empty bowls under their arms. They
nodded to each other without speaking: they had brought
wedding-presents for the young clergyman, who was to be married to
his bride--the Church.</p>
<p>As the vesper-bell rang, Valentine released the hand of his son,
who quickly folded his hands; Valentine also brought his hands
together over his heavy tools and said an Ave.</p>
<p>Next morning a clear, bright day rose upon the village. Ivo was
dressed by his mother betimes in a new jacket of striped Manchester
cloth, with buttons which he took for silver, and a newly-washed
pair of leathern breeches. He was to carry the crucifix. Gretchen,
Ivo's eldest sister, took him by the hand and led him into the
street, "so as to have room in the house." Having enjoined upon him
by no means to go back, she returned hastily. Wherever he came he
found the men standing in knots in the road. They were but half
dressed for the festival, having no coats on, but displaying their
dazzling white shirt-sleeves. Here and there women or girls were to
be seen running from house to house without bodices, and with their
hair half untied. Ivo thought it cruel in his sister to have pushed
him out of the house as she had done. He would have been delighted
to have appeared like the grown folks,--first in negligee, and then
in full dress amid the tolling of bells and the clang of trumpets;
but he did not dare to return, or even to sit down anywhere, for
fear of spoiling his clothes. He went through the village almost on
tiptoe. Wagon after wagon rumbled in, bringing farmers and farmers'
wives from abroad; at the houses people welcomed them, and brought
chairs to assist them in getting down. All the world looked as
exultingly quiet and glad as a community preparing to receive a
hero who had gone forth from their midst and was returning after a
victory. From the church to the hill-top the road was strewn with
flowers and grass, which sent forth aromatic odors. The squire was
seen coming out of Christian the tailor's, and only covered his
head when he found himself in the middle of the street. Soges had a
new sword, brightly japanned and glittering in the sun.</p>
<p>The squire's wife soon followed, leading her daughter Barbara,
who was but six years old, by the hand. Barbara was dressed in
bridal array. She wore the veil and the wreath upon her head, and a
beautiful gown. As an immaculate virgin, she was intended to
represent the bride of the young clergyman, the Church.</p>
<p>At the first sound of the bell the people in shirt-sleeves
disappeared as if by magic. They retired to their houses to finish
their toilet: Ivo went on to the church.</p>
<p>Amid the ringing of all the bells, the procession at last issued
from the church-door. The pennons waved, the band of music brought
from Horb struck up, and the audible prayers of the men and women
mingled with the sound. Ivo, with the schoolmaster at his side,
took the lead, carrying the crucifix. On the hill the altar was
finely decorated; the chalices and the lamps and the spangled
dresses of the saints flashed in the sun, and the throng of
worshipers covered the common and the adjoining fields as far as
the eye could reach. Ivo hardly took courage to look at the
"gentleman," meaning the young clergyman, who, in his gold-laced
robe, and bare head crowned with a golden wreath, ascended the
steps of the altar with pale and sober mien, bowing low as the
music swelled, and folding his small white hands upon his breast.
The squire's Barbara, who carried a burning taper wreathed with
rosemary, had gone before him and took her stand at the side of the
altar. The mass began; and at the tinkling of the bell all fell
upon their faces, and not a sound would have been heard, had not a
flight of pigeons passed directly over the altar with that
fluttering and chirping noise which always accompanies their motion
through the air. For all the world Ivo would not have looked up
just then; for he knew that the Holy Ghost was descending, to
effect the mysterious transubstantiation of the wine into blood and
the bread into flesh, and that no mortal eye can look upon Him
without being struck with blindness.</p>
<p>The chaplain of Horb now entered the pulpit, and solemnly
addressed the "permitiant."</p>
<p>Then the latter took his place. Ivo sat near by, on a stool;
with his right arm resting on his knee, and his chin upon his hand,
he listened attentively. He understood little of the sermon; but
his eyes hung upon the preacher's lips, and his mind followed his
intentions if not his thoughts.</p>
<p>When the procession returned to the church amid the renewed peal
of the bells and triumphant strains of music, Ivo clasped the
crucifix firmly with both his hands; he felt as if new strength had
been given him to carry his God before him.</p>
<p>As the crowd dispersed, every one spoke in raptures of the
"gentleman" and of the happiness of the parents of such a son.
Christian the tailor and his wife came down the covered stairs of
the church-hill in superior bliss. Ordinarily they attracted little
attention in the village; but on this occasion all crowded around
them with the greatest reverence, to present their
congratulations.</p>
<p>The young clergyman's mother returned thanks with tearful eyes;
she could scarcely speak for joyous weeping. Ivo heard his cousin,
who had come over from Rexingen, say that Gregory's parents were
now obliged to address their son with the formal pronoun "they," by
which strangers and great personages are spoken to, instead of the
simple "thee and thou," by which German villagers converse with
each other.</p>
<p>"Is that so, mother?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Of course," was the answer: "he's more than other folks
now."</p>
<p>With all their enthusiasm, the good people did not forget the
pecuniary advantage gained by Christian the tailor. It was said
that he need take no further trouble all his life. Cordele,
Gregory's sister, was to be her brother's housekeeper, and her
brother was a fortune to his family and an honor to all the
village.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PEASANT-NURSE_AND_THE_PRINCE"></a>THE
PEASANT-NURSE AND THE PRINCE</h2>
<p>"There, my boy! Now you've seen the sun. May you see it for
seven and seventy years to come, and when they've run their course,
may the Lord grant you a new lease of life. Last night they lit
millions of lamps for your sake. But they were nothing to the sun
up in heaven, which the Lord himself lighted for you this very
morning. Be a good boy, always, so that you may deserve to have the
sun shine on you. Yes, now the angel's whispering to you. Laugh
while you sleep! That's right. There's one angel belongs to you on
earth, and that's your mother! And you're mine, too! You're mine,
indeed!"</p>
<p>Thus spake Walpurga, the nurse, her voice soft, yet full of
emotion, while she gazed into the face of the child that lay in her
lap. Her soul was already swayed by that mysterious bond of
affection which never fails to develop itself in the heart of the
foster-mother. It is a noble trait in human nature, that we love
those on whom we can confer a kindness. Their whole life gradually
becomes interwoven with our own.</p>
<p>Walpurga became oblivious of herself and of all that was dear to
her in the cottage by the lake. She was now needed here, where a
young life had been assigned to her loving-charge.</p>
<p>She looked up at Mademoiselle Kramer, with beaming eyes, and met
a joyful glance in return.</p>
<p>"It seems to me," said Walpurga, "that a palace is just like a
church. One has only good and pious thoughts here; and all the
people are so kind and frank."</p>
<p>Mademoiselle Kramer suddenly smiled and replied:--</p>
<p>"My dear child--"</p>
<p>"Don't call me 'child'! I'm not a child! I'm a mother!"</p>
<p>"But here, in the great world, you are only a child. A court is
a strange place. Some go hunting, others go fishing; one builds,
another paints; one studies a r&ocirc;le, another a piece of music;
a dancer learns a new step, an author writes a new book. Every one
in the land is doing something--cooking or baking, drilling or
practicing, writing, painting, or dancing--simply in order that the
king and queen may be entertained."</p>
<p>"I understand you," said Walpurga; and Mademoiselle Kramer
continued:--</p>
<p>"My family has been in the service of the court for sixteen
generations;"--six would have been the right number, but sixteen
sounded so much better;--"my father is the governor of the summer
palace, and I was born there. I know all about the court, and can
teach you a great deal."</p>
<p>"And I'll be glad to learn," interposed Walpurga.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
